**Python:**
- Have unlimited precision and dynamically manage memory
- Ideal for tasks requiring large numbers without fixed size constraints
- However, operations can be slower due to dynamic memory management.

**NumPy:**
- NumPy integers (`np.int8`, `np.int16`, `np.int32`, `np.int64`, etc.) are fixed-size
- Efficient memory usage and faster operations for numerical computations. 
- They are well-suited for large arrays and performance-critical tasks but have a limited range of values.
