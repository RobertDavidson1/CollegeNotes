>[!eq] Note
> 	 Unsupervised learning can highlight the intrinsic information about the data

**Example:** Dimension Reduction
- Take *high-dimensional data, and return lower dimensional data* that still retains most of the information
	- usually *info = total variance*
- Used for:
	- **Visualization** (10 dimensions to 2)
	- **Speed up model training** (2000 dimensions to 400)
