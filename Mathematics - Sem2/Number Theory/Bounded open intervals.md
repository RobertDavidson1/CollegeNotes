- Previously we've shown that $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ and $\mathbb{R}$ have the same cardinality
- Our goal in this section is to show that the set $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable and all it's elements cannot be listed or put into a bijective correspondence

>- At the end we've constructed a new number, that has not been listed
