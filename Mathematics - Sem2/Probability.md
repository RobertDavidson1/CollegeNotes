>$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$

>[!eq] Probability that A and B both occur 
>$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$$


>[!eq] Probability of A, given B has occurred (non-independent) 
>$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P\left(A\right)\cdot P\left(B|A\right)}{P\left(B\right)}$$

### Reference:
$P(A) = \text{Probability of A}$
$P(B) = \text{Probability of B}$
$P(A\mid B) = \text{Probability of A given B}$
$P(B\mid A) = \text{Probability of B given A}$
$P(A\cup B) = \text{Probability of both A or B or both}$
$P(A\cap B) = \text{Probability of both A and B}$
