>[!eq] Proof:
>- If  a sequence is convergent is must be bounded
>- Suppose that $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a convergent sequence with limit $L$
>- Then by definition of convergence there exists a natural number $N$ such that every term of the sequence after $a_N$ is between $L-1$ and $L+1$
>- The set consisting of thee first $N$ terms of the sequence is a finite set: it has a maximum element $M1$ and minimum element $m1$
>- Let $M = \max\set{M_1,L+1}$ and let $m = \min\set{m1, L-1}$ 
>	- Then $a_n$ is bounded above by $M$ and bounded below by $m$
>- So our sequence is bounded
