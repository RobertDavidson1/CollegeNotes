___
### Natural Numbers

>[!eq] Natural Numbers (N)
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- The set of positive integers, typically starting from 1 and increasing by increments of 1. They are used for counting and do not include zero or any negative numbers.
>> 
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}\end{array}$

___
### Whole Numbers

>[!eq] Whole Numbers (W)
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- This set includes all natural numbers along with zero. It does not include negative numbers or fractions.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\W = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}\end{array}$

___
### Integers

>[!eq] Integers (Z)
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- Integers include all whole numbers and their negative counterparts. Fractions and decimals are not considered integers.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\Z = \{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}\end{array}$

___
### Rational Numbers

>[!eq] Rational Numbers (Q)
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- These numbers can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. This includes integers, finite decimals, and repeating decimals.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\Q = \left\{\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{4}, 0.5, -0.333..., \frac{2}{1}\right\}\end{array}$

___
### Irrational Numbers

>[!eq] Irrational Numbers
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- These numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\\{ \sqrt{2}, \pi, e, ...\}\end{array}$

___
### Real Numbers

>[!eq] Real Numbers (R)
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- The set of real numbers includes all rational and irrational numbers. It encompasses any number that can represent a distance along a line.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\R = \{ -\sqrt{2}, \frac{3}{4}, \pi, -1, 0, 2.718..., ...\}\end{array}$

___
### Complex Numbers

>[!eq] Complex Numbers (C)
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- These numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part and are generally written in the form a + bi, where "a" and "b" are real numbers, and "i" is the square root of -1.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\C = \{3 + 4i, -2 - i, ...\}\end{array}$

___
### Imaginary Numbers

>[!eq] Imaginary Numbers
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>- A special category of complex numbers where the real part is zero, and the coefficient of "i" is not zero.
>>
>> 	$\begin{array}{l}\underline{\text{Example:}} \\\{3i, -i, ...\}\end{array}$
