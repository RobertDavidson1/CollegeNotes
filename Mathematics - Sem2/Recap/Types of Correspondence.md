>[!eq] Injective:
>- If different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain
>- *Mnemonic:* **Inject**ion (no two injections can go to the same place)


>[!eq] Surjective:
> Every element in the codomain, there exists one element in domain that maps to it
> - *Mnemonic:* **Sur**f (surf over the entire domain)

>[!eq] Bijective (both injective and surjective):
>Every element in domain maps to all and  unique elements in codomain
