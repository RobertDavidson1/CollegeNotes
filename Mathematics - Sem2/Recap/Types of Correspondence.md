>[!eq] **Injective:** 
>If different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain


>[!eq] **Surjective:** 
> Every element in the codomain, there exists one element in domain that maps to it

>[!eq] Bijective (both injective and surjective):
>Every element in domain maps to all and  unique elements in codomain
