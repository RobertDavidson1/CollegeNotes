>[!eq] Definition
>- A set with two operations: addition and multiplication that satisfies the properties of a commutative ring with additional requirements for multiplication.

>[!eq] The Fundamental Properties
>1. **Addition**:
>	- Closed under addition. For any two elements $a$ and $b$, $a + b$ is in the set.
>	- Associative. $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.
>	- Additive identity. Exists an element $0$ such that for any element $a$, $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$.
>	- Additive inverse. For every element $a$, exists $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.
>	- Commutative. $a + b = b + a$.
>2. **Multiplication** (excluding $0$):
>	- Closed under multiplication. For any two elements $a$ and $b$, $a \times b$ is in the set.
>	- Associative. $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$.
>	- Multiplicative identity. Exists an element $1$ (not $0$) such that for any element $a$, $a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a$.
>	- Multiplicative inverse. For every element $a$ (except $0$), exists $a^{-1}$ such that $a \times a^{-1} = 1$.
>	- Commutative. $a \times b = b \times a$.
>3. **Distributive Property**:
>	- Multiplication distributes over addition. $a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)$ and $(b + c) \times a = (b \times a) + (c \times a)$.

>[!eq] Example
>- The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ forms a field.
>	- It satisfies all
