- Two polynomials are *equal* if they have the **same coefficient** for every power of $x$
- A polynomial $p(x)$ defined a polynomial function $R \to R$ by the rule $a \mapsto p(a)$
 - The set the of all polynomials over $R$ is denoted  by $R[x]$
 - $R[x]$ is a **[[Rings of Polynomials|commutative ring]]**
