>[!eq] **Functions are Relations are Sets**
> - A **function** $f$ from a domain $X$ to a codomain $Y$ is a relation $f \subseteq X \times Y$, with the property that, for every $x \in X$, there is a unique $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in f$. This is often called the Vertical Line Test.

>[!eq] **Notation**
> - Write $f: X \rightarrow Y$ for a function from $X$ to $Y$ and $f(x) = y$ for the unique $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in f$.
> - A function thus consists of three things: a domain $X$ and a codomain $Y$ together with a rule $f \subseteq X \times Y$ that associates to each point $x \in X$ a unique value $f(x) = y \in Y$.

>[!feynman] Feynman Technique
>Imagine a function as a machine in a factory: this machine is special because for every item (let's say a raw material) you put into it, you always get a specific product out. The raw materials represent the domain, and the possible products represent the codomain.
>
>When we say the machine is a function, we mean that every single raw material has its own unique productâ€”it's not possible to put in a raw material and get out two or more different products. This unique pairing is like the Vertical Line Test, which checks if a machine (function) is working correctly, ensuring it doesn't produce two different things from the same raw material.
>
>The notation $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is like saying our machine takes materials from group $X$ and turns them into products in group $Y$. And when we write $f(x) = y$, we're saying, "Look, when you put in material $x$, you'll get out product $y$," which is a guarantee of the machine's function.
