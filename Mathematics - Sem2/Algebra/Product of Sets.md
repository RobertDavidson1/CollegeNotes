>[!eq] **Definition**
> The **Cartesian product** of sets $A$ and $B$ is the set $A \times B = \{(a, b) : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$ of all (ordered) pairs $(a, b)$.

>[!eq] **Examples**
> - If $A = \{1,2,3\}$, $B = \{X, Y\}$, then $A \times B = \{(1,X), (1,Y), (2,X), (2,Y), (3,X), (3,Y)\}$.
> ___
> - For a single set $A = \{1,3\}$, $A^2 = A \times A = \{(1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)\}$.
> ___
> - More generally, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the Cartesian product of $n$ sets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n$ is the set $S_1 \times S_2 \times \ldots \times S_n = \{(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) : x_i \in S_i\}$ of all $n$-tuples $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$.
> - $A^n = A \times A \times \ldots \times A$ (n factors).

>Imagine you have two bags: one with numbers and another with letters. The Cartesian product of these two bags is like pairing each number with each letter to see all possible combinations. If you have the numbers 1, 2, and 3 and the letters X and Y, your pairs would be all the mix-and-match ways you can combine a number with a letter.
>
>When you do this with just one bag, like a bag with the numbers 1 and 3, you pair each number with itself and each other, like deciding on teams for a game where everyone has to play with everyone else, including themselves.
>
>If you have more bags, you just keep making more teams, always making sure everyone gets a turn with everyone from each bag. This is how you can imagine the Cartesian product of multiple sets.
