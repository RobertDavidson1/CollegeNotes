___
## 2nd Law Implies the 1st Law
- If no force is applied, then acceleration is 0, and hence, velocity is constant
	- Hence, the 2nd Law implies the 1st Law.
___
## Equation of Motion
- Let **$F$** denote the applied force, and **$a$** denote the acceleration
- The second law states that: *$F = m\cdot a$*
	- for some constant $m$
- Experimentally, $m$, is observed to depend on the material the body is made of, and is called *Inertial Mass* - which is proportional to the "amount" of material in the body  
___
## Units:
- $m$ = kg
- $a$ = $ms^{-2}$
- Hence F is measured in $kg\cdot ms^{-1}$
	- We define 1 Newton ($N$) = 1 $kg \cdot ms^{-2}$
