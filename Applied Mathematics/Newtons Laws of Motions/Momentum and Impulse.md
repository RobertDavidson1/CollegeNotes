- [[First and Second Laws |Newtons Second Law]] states that:
	$F = ma = m\dfrac{dv}{dt}$
 - We define *$p = mv$ to be the momentum* of a particle of a mass $m$ with $v$
	 - **Units:** 
		 - In general |p| = $MLT^-1$ (Mass Length Time)
		 - For example, $kg m/s$ in SI
	 - Then we have $F = \dfrac{dp}{dt}$
		 - This is a useful way to express Newton 2nd Law then **two or more particles are being considered**

## Impulse:
- Suppose that a force $F$ acts on a particle over a time $0 \leq t \leq T$
- The **impulse (I)**  this force imparts on the particle over this time is:
$$I = \int_{0}^T F\;dt$$
- We now see that:
$$\int_{0}^T (\dfrac{dp}{dt})dt = \int_{0}^T F\;dt \rightarrow p(T) - p(0) = \int_{0}^T F\;dt = I$$
- So that, **change in momentum = impulse**
	- Hence, impulse is the chance in momentum over some time period $T$

## Examples:
>[!faq] Suppose that velocity changes from initial velocity (u) to initial velocity (v) under a constant force $F$
>- *Recall*:
>Impulse = change in momentum = $mv-mu$ 
>Impulse = $\int_{0}^T Fdt = [Ft]_{0}^T = FT$ for a constant force F
><br>
>- *So:*
>$$mv-mu = FT$$
>$$mv - mu = maT$$
>- *Dividing by $m$ we obtain:*
>$$v - u = aT$$

>[!faq]- A car of mass 2000 kg travelling with velocity 20 m/s collides with a wall. Find the impulse imparted to the car. If the collision takes place over 1/4 s find the average force on the car
