## Example
![[Pasted image 20231005142128.png | center]]
- A mass $m$ at rest on a level surface under gravity.
- Let $N$ = force of interaction between surface and block *(force on block due to surface)*
- Block at rest implies the Total Force downwards = 0, 
- That is:$$N + mg = 0 \Rightarrow N = -mg$$
- But the force pressing down on the surface from the block is $mg$
- i.e. **The forces are exactly opposite as in Newton's 3rd Law**
