- Suppose two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ with initial velocities $u_1$ and $u_2$ interact over time interval $T$. 
- We assume that this interaction force is the only one present
<br>
- By [[Newton's Third Law]]:
	$F_{12}$ = force on $m_1$ due to $m_2$ = $-$ force on $m_2$ due to $m_1$
- After a time $T$ $m_1$ has velocity $v_1$ and and $m_2$ has velocity $v_2$
<br>
- Impulse on $m_1 = m_1v_1 - m_1u_1 = \int_{0}^T\; F_{12}\;dt = -\int_{0}^T F{21}\;dt = -$ impulse on $m_2 = -(m_2v_2 - m_2u_2)$  
<br>
- **Thus:**
$$m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 = m_1v_1 - m_2v_2$$
- This is an important equation referred to as conservation of momentum.
- The momentum of each particle changes due to the impulse
	- However **total momentum** is conserved
	- i.e. $p_1 + p_2$ = constant

## Examples
>[!faq]- A mass of 2 kg moves at 4 m/s and collides with a mass of 3 kg moving  at 2 m/s. If the 2 kg mass velocity reduces to 1 m/s, find the impulse and final velocity of 3 kg mass.
>Impulse on 2kg = -6 kg m/s
>Impulse on 3kg = 6 kg m/s

>[!faq]- A mass m1 with velocity u collides with a mass m2 at rest. If they coalesce, find the final velocity v of the combined mass.
>$$v = \dfrac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}u$$
