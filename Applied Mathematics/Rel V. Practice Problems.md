>- Two ships pass near each other off the coast of Ireland. 
>- A ship-watcher on the coast observes ship A heading East at 15 km/hr, while she observes ship B heading North West. 
>- According to measurements taken on ship A, ship B is heading 30o North of West. 
>- **Find the speed of ship B relative to the observer on the coast**
