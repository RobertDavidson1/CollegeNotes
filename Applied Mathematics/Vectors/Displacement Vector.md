## Displacement Vector:
- consider an object located at some point $A$ which is displaced to another point $B$
- Any displacement is described by the direction and distance moved
- The displacement vector is a magnitude given by this distance and direction as given
- We can represent this displacement vector as an arrow pointing from $A$ to $B$ who's magnitude is the length of the arrow
- **Notation:**
	- We will donate any vector by boldface print letters
	- This is most commonly used notation for vectors in textbooks
	- However, when writing vectors we use $\large \vec a$ or $\large \underline a$
	- These *notations are designed to distinguish vectors from scalar variables*
- **Magnitude:**
	- Magnitude of $a$ is denoted by $|a|$ and is a non-negative scalar
- **Shorthand convention:**
	- Often the magnitude $|a|$ is denoted by $a$ (not boldface or underlined)
	- For this reason above it is essential to be *careful and clear in your use of vector notation.*
