## Example:
- Suppose $a,b,c$, shown below, describe displacement of an object
- Then the resulting displacement described by $a,b,c$ is clearly the same
- Hence, **the location** of the arrow representing the vector is irrelevant
- In general, two vectors are said to be equal when they have **the same magnitude and direction**
- Thus $a = b = c$
