>- A pulley system consists of an inextensible rope fixed at one end to the ceiling which then passes around a smooth moving pulley and then around a second smooth pulley also attached to the ceiling as shown. A mass m1 is attached to the free end of the rope and a second mass m2 to the moving pulley. 
>- Find the accelerations of m1 and m2

>- The two sections of rope conncted to m2 are reduced by d2 in length
>- Hence change in length of rope is: 
>	- $x -2y$
>- But the rope is assumed to be inextensible so that $x = 2y$
>	- m1 moves twice the distance of m2
>- This is true for all time, so deriving velocity, $\dot{x} = \dot{y}$
>	- and acceleration: $\ddot{x} = \ddot{y}$
>- Thus letting $a$ be the acceleration of $m_1$ downwards then $a/2$ is the acceleration of m2 upwards
>___
>**Solving:**
>- The total downwards force is $m_1g -T$ so that:
>	- $\large m_1a = m_1g - T\quad\quad\quad\text{(1)}$
>- The total upwards force for $m_2$ is $2T-m_2g$, twice the tension arising from the two sections of rope connected to m2
>- Hence:
>	- $\large m_2\frac{a}{2}=2T-m2g\quad\quad\quad\text{(2)}$
>- Thus $2(1) + 2$ gives
>$$(2m_1+\frac{m2}{2})a = 2m1g -m2g$$
>$$\downarrow$$
>$$a = \dfrac{2m1-m2}{2m1+\frac{m2}{2}}g$$
