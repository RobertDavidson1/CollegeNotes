1. **Constant Velocity:** When a particle is moving with a constant velocity, it means that its speed and direction of motion remain the same over time. In three-dimensional space, this velocity is represented by a vector, often denoted as $\dot{\mathbf{r}} =\mathbf{u} = u_1\hat{i} + u_2\hat{j} + u_3\hat{k}$, where $u_1$, $u_2$, and $u_3$ are constants representing the velocity components in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
    
2. **Time Derivatives:** To describe the motion of the particle, we can find the time derivatives of its position with respect to time ($t$). These derivatives are represented as $\dot{x}$, $\dot{y}$, and $\dot{z}$, and they give us the rate of change of position in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
    
3. **Constant Derivatives:** If the particle is moving with a constant velocity, as given by $\mathbf{u}$, then the time derivatives of its position components are also constant, which means they do not change with time. This is evident from the expressions:
    
    - $\dot{x} = u_1$ (a constant)
    - $\dot{y} = u_2$ (a constant)
    - $\dot{z} = u_3$ (a constant)
4. **Position Equations:** To find the position of the particle at any time $t$, you can integrate these constant derivatives with respect to time. When you perform the integration, you get the following equations for the position components:
    
    - $x(t) = u_1t + C_1$, where $C_1$ is an integration constant.
    - $y(t) = u_2t + C_2$, where $C_2$ is an integration constant.
    - $z(t) = u_3t + C_3$, where $C_3$ is an integration constant.
5. **Interpretation of Constants:** The integration constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ represent the initial positions of the particle at the starting time, $t = 0$. They are determined by the particle's initial position along the respective axes. In other words, at $t = 0$, the particle is located at coordinates $(C_1, C_2, C_3)$.

1. **Initial Position:** At time $t = 0$, the particle is located at the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$. This means that the particle starts at a specific position in space.
2. **Linear Motion:** The equations provided, such as $x = x_0 + u_1t$, describe how the particle's position changes with time. Specifically:
- $x = x_0 + u_1t$ means that in the x-direction, the particle's position increases linearly with time. This means it moves in a straight line along the x-axis.
- Similarly, $y = y_0 + u_2t$ and $z = z_0 + u_3t$ indicate linear motion along the y and z directions, respectively.
	- $x = x_{0}+ u_{1}t$
	- $y = y_{0}+ u_{2}t$
	- $z = z_{0}+ u_{3}t$
3. **Tangent Line:** These equations represent the position of the particle at any time $t$, and they form a straight line in three-dimensional space. The point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is the starting point of this line. Importantly, the direction of this line is determined by the velocity vector $\mathbf{u}$. In fact, the vector $\mathbf{u}$ is tangent to the line at all points along the line.

So, in summary, the equations describe the motion of the particle along a straight line that passes through the initial position $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and is in the constant direction of the velocity vector $\mathbf{u}$. The tangent line to the curve at any point on the line is parallel to the direction of motion, which is determined by the velocity vector.
