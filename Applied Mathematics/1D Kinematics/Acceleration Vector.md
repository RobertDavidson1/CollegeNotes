- Velocity can depend on t also, as seen in the last example [[Velocity Vector#^16e984 |here]]
- The rate of change of velocity with respect to time is the **acceleration vector**
$$a = \dfrac{dv}{dt} = \dfrac{d^2r}{dt^2}$$
___
## Example:
- For $v = \hat i + t\hat j$
- We have $a = j$

- We can also write: 
	- $v = \dot r$
	- $a = \dot v = \ddot r$
