- A consider a line in the $x,y$ plane, with initial point $r_0$ and velocity $u = u_{1}\hat i + u_{2}\hat j + u_{3}\hat k$
1. **Line Equations:** We start with the components of the position vector:
    
    - $x = x_0 + u_1t$
    - $y = y_0 + u_2t$
2. **Solving for t:** Solve these equations for time $t$ by isolating it in terms of $x$ and $y$:
    
    - $t = \frac{x - x_0}{u_1}$ (from the first equation)
    - $t = \frac{y - y_0}{u_2}$ (from the second equation)
3. **Ratio of Changes:** By setting these two expressions for $t$ equal to each other, we have derive the equation:
    
    - $\frac{y - y_0}{x - x_0} = \frac{u_2}{u_1}$
4. **Standard Equation of a Line:** The equation you derived is in the form of the standard equation of a line in the $x, y$ plane. It represents a line passing through the point $(x_0, y_0)$ and has a slope of $u_2/u_1$, which is the tangent of the angle $\theta$ that this line makes with the positive x-axis. In trigonometric terms, $\tan\theta$ is the slope of the line.
    
5. **Special Cases:** You've correctly identified the special cases:
    
    - If $u_1 = 0$, it means that the line is vertical in the $x, y$ plane (parallel to the y-axis), and its slope is undefined. In this case, $\theta = 90^\circ$.
    - If $u_2 = 0$, it means that the line is horizontal (parallel to the x-axis), and its slope is zero. In this case, $\theta = 0^\circ$.
