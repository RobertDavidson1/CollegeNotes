- Let a, b be two vectors and define the angle $\theta$ between a, b by joining  
their tails as follows:

<br>

- The scalar \ dot product of $a$ and $b$ is the following scalar quantity:
$$a\cdot b \equiv |a||b|cos\theta$$
- Note, imagine $a = 2i + 3j + 5k$
	- Then the magnitude of $a$ is $|a| = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2+5^2} = \sqrt{38}$

## Example:
- $\hat{i},\hat j, \hat k$ have the following scalar product
$$\hat i \cdot \hat i = |i||i|cos\theta = 1\times 1\times cos(0)= 1$$
The same is true for $\hat j \cdot \hat j$ and $\hat k \cdot \hat k$ since the angle between themselves is 0

<br>

- Also consider $\hat i\cdot \hat j$, $\theta = 90$:
$$\hat i \cdot \hat j = |i||j| cos\theta = |i||j| cos(90) = |i||j| \times 0 = 0$$
The same is true for the other vectors $(\hat i \cdot \hat k \quad and \quad \hat j \cdot \hat k)$

## Note:
- These results are unlike ordinary multiplication 
- In ordinary multiplication of two number $(x,y)$
	- If $xy = 0$ then either $x$ or $y = 0$
