- Let $a$ be any vector
- Then the vector magnitude $|a|$ but opposite direction to $a$ is denoted by $-a$

- Then $a+(-a) = 0$, where $0$ is the zero vector of zero magnitude
- The definition for $-a$ for any vector $a$ allows us to define a subtraction for vectors $a,b$ as follows$$a-b = a+(-b)$$

- We can also see this by looking at the other diagonal in the parallelogram law:$$b + (a-b) = a$$
