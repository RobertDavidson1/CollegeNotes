## Remarks:
1. $F_{21}$ is in the direction of $-\hat r$ 
	-  Since $m_2$ is attracted to $m_1$

2. The magnitude is:
	- $\large |F_{21}| = -\frac{{Gm_{1}m_{2}}}{r^{3}}\cdot |-r| = -\frac{{Gm_{1}m_{2}}}{r^{2}}\quad \normalsize\text{Inverse Square Law}$
3. The position vector of $m_1$ relative to $m_2$ is $-r$
	- Hence the force on $m_1$ due to $m_2$ is
	- $\large F_{12} = -\frac{{Gm_{1}m_{2}}}{r^{3}}\cdot(-r) = F_{21}$ 
4. $m_{1}, m_{2}$ are the grav. masses of each body. 
	- This is found to be the same as **inertial mass**
	- This is called the principled of equivalence
	- A person standing on a lift cannot tell between acceleration due to gravity $g$ and acceleration in free space $a = g$
5. Consider two $1kg$ masses $1m$ apart. The force of mutual attraction is of magnitude:
	- $\large G \frac{1.1}{1^{2}} = 6.67\times 10^{-11} \text{N}\quad\text{Very small..}$
	- Grav. Forces are very small unless $m_{1}, m_{2}$ are large **or** $r$ is very small
