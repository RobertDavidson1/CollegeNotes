- Any vector $a$ which is of magnitude $|a| = 1$ is called a **unit vector**
- Unit vectors are very useful when we wish to describe direction only
- **Notation:**
	- Unit vectors are often defined with a 'hat'
	- Thus **$\large \hat{a}$** is a unit vector
		- That is $|\hat{a}|$ = 1
- **Example:**
	- Given any non-zero vector $a$ we can always construct a unit vector in the direction of $a$, that is 
	$$\hat{b} = \dfrac{1}{|a|}a$$
	- Then:
	$$|\hat{b}| = \dfrac{1}{|a|}\cdot |a| = 1$$
	- **Suppose $b = \lambda a$. Can we solve $\lambda$ in terms of $a$ and $b$?**
	- Take magnitudes:
	- $|b| = |\lambda||a|$
	- $|\lambda| = \dfrac{|b|}{|a|} = \pm \lambda$
		- provided $|a| \neq 0$

	- **Note 1:**
		- $b = \lambda a$ implies $a$ and $b$ are parallel
	- **Note 2:**
		- $b = \lambda a \neq \lambda = \dfrac{b}{a}$
	- **We cannot define $\dfrac{b}{a}$ in any meaningful way**
