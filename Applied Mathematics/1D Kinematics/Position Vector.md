- Let $O$ , the origin denote some **reference point**
- We can define the **position vector of $r$ of any point $P$ relative to $O$** as the *displacement vector from $O$ to $P$*

- We have formerly consider position **$s$** for a particle moving along a line
- In that case the direction of the position vector is the direction along the line
- The magnitude $|r|$ of $r$ is often denoted by $r$ using the shorthand convention
	- That is, **$r$ is the distance from $O$ to $P$**
- Note:
	- We must be clear in the use of notion here:
	- $\vec r$  or $\underline r$ denote the position **vector**
	- Whereas $r$ denote the magnitude of the vector
