>[!eq] Problem 1
> - Suppose a particle of mass 1kg is initially at (1,0,0) and with initial velocity $-j+2k$
> - Moved under **constant force** $F = -i + 2j$
> - Find position and velocity for all time:
> ___
> 
> $\vec{r}(0) = 1i$
> $\vec{F} = \vec{a}(1kg) = \vec{a}= -i + 2j$ 
>
>$\text{We have}:$
>$\vec{a} = -i + 2j \to \cases{\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -1\\\\\dfrac{d^2y}{dt^2}= 2\\\\\dfrac{d^2z}{dt} = 0}$
