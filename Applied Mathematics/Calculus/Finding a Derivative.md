- To find the derivative of a function **y = f(x)** we use the [[Slope]] formula
- ![[slope-dy-dx2.svg]]
- And from the diagram we see that:
	- x changes from **$x$** to **$x+\triangle x$**
	- x changes from **$f(x)$** to **$f(x+\triangle x)$**
- Now follow these steps
	1. Fill in the *slope formula*: $$\dfrac {\triangle y}{\triangle x} = \dfrac {f(x + \triangle x) - f(x)}{\triangle x}$$
	2. Simplify as best we can
	3. Make $\triangle x$ shrink towards 0

## Example:
- Find the derivative of f(x) = $x^2$
1. Start with $f(x + \triangle x) = (x+\triangle x)^2$
2. Expand $(x+\triangle x)^2$: $f(x +\triangle x) = x^2 +2\triangle x + (\triangle x)^2$
