- Let $P(t)$ be a population size at time $t$
- Assume the rate of growth is proportional to $P$, that is:
$$\dfrac{dP}{dt} = kP$$
- For some constant $k > 0$.
___
Let $P(0) = P_0$ denote initial population:
$$\int_{P_0}^P \dfrac{1}{P}dP = \int_{0}^t kdt$$
So that:
	$$[ln\;P]_{P_0}^P = kt \rightarrow ln\;P -ln\;P_0 = kt\rightarrow ln\dfrac{P}{P_0}= kt$$
Exponentiate to find:
$$P = P_0\;exp(kt)$$
That is, exponential explosion in population growth as $t$ increases
