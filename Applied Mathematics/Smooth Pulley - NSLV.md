>- A block of mass $m1$ under gravity slides down a smooth inclined plane at an angle $k$ to the horizontal. The block is attached to a light inextensible rope which passes over a smooth pulley and is connected to a second mass $m2$. 
>- Find the accelerations of the two masses and the tension in the rope.

>**m1:**
>$m_1gsin(k) - T = m_1a$
>**m2:**
>$T-m2_g = m_2a$
>**Adding m1+m2:**
>$m_1gsin(k)-m_2(g) = (m1+m2)(a)$
>**Solving for a:**
>$a = \dfrac{m_1gsin(k)-m_2(g)}{(m1+m2)}$
>**Solving for $T$**
>$T = m2a + m2g\quad\text{From Above}$
>$T = m2\left(\dfrac{m_1gsin(k)-m_2(g)}{(m1+m2)}\right)+ m2g$
>*Simplifying:*
>$$T = \dfrac{m1m2}{m1+m2}\cdot(g)(1+sin(k))$$
