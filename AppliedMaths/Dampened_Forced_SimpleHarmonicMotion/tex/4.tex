\maketitle

\section*{Problem Statement}
Find the general solution to the differential equation:
\[ \ddot{x} + 4x = t - 1. \]

\section*{Solution}
The given differential equation is second-order and linear with constant coefficients. To find the general solution, we separate it into two parts: the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.

\subsection*{Homogeneous Solution}
For the homogeneous equation:
\[ \ddot{x} + 4x = 0, \]
we find the characteristic equation:
\[ m^2 + 4 = 0. \]
The solutions to the characteristic equation are \( m = \pm 2i \), which gives us the general homogeneous solution:
\[ x_h(t) = A\cos(2t) + B\sin(2t), \]
where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants.

\subsection*{Particular Solution}
For the particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation, we guess a solution of the form:
\[ x_p(t) = Ct + D. \]
Substituting \( x_p(t) \) into the differential equation, we obtain:
\[ 4Ct + 4D = t - 1. \]
Matching coefficients, we find that \( C = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( D = -\frac{1}{4} \), thus giving us the particular solution:
\[ x_p(t) = \frac{1}{4}t - \frac{1}{4}. \]

\subsection*{General Solution}
The general solution to the differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:
\[ x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t) = A\cos(2t) + B\sin(2t) + \frac{1}{4}t - \frac{1}{4}. \]

This function describes the motion of the system for any given time \( t \), where the constants \( A \) and \( B \) can be determined by the initial conditions.
