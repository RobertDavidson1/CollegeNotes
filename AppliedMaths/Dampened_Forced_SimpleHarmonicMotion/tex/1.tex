\section*{Question}
Solve the differential equation of damped harmonic motion
\[ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0 \]
for \(i\) \(b = \sqrt{5}\), \(ii\) \(b = 2\) and \(iii\) \(b = \sqrt{3}\). In each case find the complete solution subject to the initial condition \(x(0) = 0\), \(\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 1\), and sketch the solution. Comment on the type of damping observed.

\section*{Solution}
The characteristic equation of the differential equation is:
\[ m^2 + bm + 1 = 0 \]

\subsection*{Case (i): \(b = \sqrt{5}\)}
The characteristic equation becomes:
\[ m^2 + \sqrt{5}m + 1 = 0 \]
Solving for \(m\) yields complex roots:
\[ m = \frac{-\sqrt{5} \pm i}{2} \]
indicating that the system is underdamped. The motion will be oscillatory with decreasing amplitude over time.
The general solution is:
\[ x(t) = e^{-\sqrt{5}t/2}(C_1 \cos(t/2) + C_2 \sin(t/2)) \]
Applying the initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\), \(\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 1\), we find \(C_1 = 0\) and \(C_2 = 2\).
Thus, the solution is:
\[ x(t) = 2e^{-\sqrt{5}t/2} \sin(t/2) \]

\subsection*{Case (ii): \(b = 2\)}
The characteristic equation becomes:
\[ m^2 + 2m + 1 = 0 \]
This has a repeated real root \(m = -1\), indicating that the system is critically damped. The general solution is:
\[ x(t) = (C_1 + C_2t) e^{-t} \]
Applying the initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\), \(\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 1\), we find \(C_1 = 0\) and \(C_2 = 1\).
Thus, the solution is:
\[ x(t) = t e^{-t} \]

\subsection*{Case (iii): \(b = \sqrt{3}\)}
The characteristic equation becomes:
\[ m^2 + \sqrt{3}m + 1 = 0 \]
Solving for \(m\) yields complex roots:
\[ m = \frac{-\sqrt{3} \pm i}{2} \]
indicating that the system is underdamped. The motion will be oscillatory with decreasing amplitude over time.
The general solution is:
\[ x(t) = e^{-\sqrt{3}t/2}(C_1 \cos(t/2) + C_2 \sin(t/2)) \]
Applying the initial conditions \(x(0) = 0\), \(\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = 1\), we find \(C_1 = 0\) and \(C_2 = 2\).
Thus, the solution is:
\[ x(t) = 2e^{-\sqrt{3}t/2} \sin(t/2) \]
