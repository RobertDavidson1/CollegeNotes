- One widely accepted model holds that stock prices are [[log-normally]] distributed
- As with the [[Time Value of Money]], we should formalise this belief

>[!eq] Stock Model
>- We assume the existence of a random variable $X$
>	- Which is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
>- Such that the change in the logarithm of the stock over some time period $T$ is given by $X$
>- That is:
>$$\log S_T = log S_0 + X \quad or \quad S_t =  S_0 \exp(X)$$
