- A car of mass 1100 kg accelerates (uniformly) from rest to a speed of 30  
km/h in 12 s. Find the constant applied force.
<br>
- a) A force of 20 N is applied to a 4 kg mass for 6 s. If the initial velocity  
is 15m/s find the acceleration and distance covered. (b) After the 6  
seconds a constant force F is applied to bring the mass to rest in a  
further 125m. What is F?
<br>
- A jet of mass 8 tonnes has an engine producing a force of 40 kN. Air  
resistance is assumed constant and is of magnitude 4 kN. The engines  
are switched on and the jet accelerates from rest for 12 s. The engines  
are then switched off, and the jet decelerates to rest. (1 tonne = 1000  
kg, 1 kN = 1000 N)  
	(a) Find the acceleration while the engines are on.  
	(b) What is the jetâ€™s speed just as the engines are switched off?  
	(c) Find the distance before coming to rest in the second stage after the  
engine is switched off.
