1. A car accelerates from 16 m/s to 40 m/s over 500 m. What is the  
constant acceleration
<br>

2. A car decelerates from 36 m/s with deceleration of magnitude 3 m/s2.  
Find the time taken to cover 162 m
<br>
3. A car travels from rest with acceleration of 1 m/s2 for 20 seconds. It  
then decelerates at 2 m/s2 and comes to rest again. Find the maximum  
velocity V reached, the total distance travelled and the total time taken  
for the journey.
