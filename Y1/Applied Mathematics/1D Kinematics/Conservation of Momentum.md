- Defining the momentum vector, $p = mv$, Then:
	$$F = m\dfrac{dv}{dt}=\dfrac{dp}{dt}$$
- Explained here [[Force Momentum Derivative]]
___
- Suppose we have two masses $m_1, m_2$
	- Let $p_1$ = momentum of $m_1$
	- Let $p_2$ = momentum of $m_2$
$$\dfrac{dp_{1}}{dt}= F_{12},\quad \dfrac{dp_{2}}{dt}= F_{21}$$

___
Adding these two equations gives:
$$\dfrac{d}{dt}(p_{1}+ p_{2)}= F_{12} + F_{21} = F_{12} + (-F_{12})  = 0$$
- The derivative of $p_1 + p_{2}= 0$
	- so it's a *constant* $\to\;$**Conservation of Momentum**
