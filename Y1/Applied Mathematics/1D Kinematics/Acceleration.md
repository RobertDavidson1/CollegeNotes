- We measure the rate of change of velocity as defined by:
$$a = \dfrac{dv}{dt}$$
- That is, **acceleration is the derivative of velocity**
	- Recall velocity is the derivative of displacement in respect to time
- The acceleration is the slope of the tangent line to the [[Velocity Time Graphs]] curve
___
**We also write:**
$$a = \dfrac{dv}{dt} = \dfrac{d}{dt}\cdot \dfrac{ds}{dt}=\dfrac{d^2s}{dt^2}$$
- Denotes the 2nd derivative of s with respect to t, where $\frac{ds}{dt}$ is the first derivative
- *Shorthand Notation:* We often denote differentiation with respect to t by a dot
	- $\dot s = \dfrac{ds}{dt}, \ddot s = \dfrac{d^2s}{dt^2}$  
	- $v = \dot s$, $a = \dot v = \ddot s$
___
**Units Of Acceleration:**
- Has dimensions of  $\frac{Velocity}{Time} = \frac{Length}{Time^2}$
- S.I Units, hence, are in $m/s^2$ or $ms^{-2}$
___
### Example
> [!question]- Compute acceleration for s(t) =  At(T-t), where A,T are constant 
> $\dot s = AT - 2At$
> Thus
> $\\dot s = -2A$
