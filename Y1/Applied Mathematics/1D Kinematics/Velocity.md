- Measure of the **rate of change** of position *s(t)* as *t* changes



- Lets consider previous graphs (a) and (b)
	- Can we quantify the way *s* is varying with *t*
	- How quickly is it changing?
	- Is it moving left or right?
- In case (a) velocity is 0 since position is constant in time
- In case (b) the *s* vs *t* diagram is a line, as shown below:

- Consider motion from position *s1 = s(t1)*  at time t1 to *s2 = s(t2)* at time t2
- The change in position is s2 - s1, which is compared to change in time t2 - t1
- Thus we can define velocity **v** by 
$$v = \dfrac{s2-s1}{t2-t1}$$
- Geometrically this is just the slope *$tan\; \theta$*
- Since *s* is measured in meters and *t* in seconds then v is measure in meters per second, that is *$ms^{-1}$*
