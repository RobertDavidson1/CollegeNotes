- **Velocity Vector:** $v = \frac{dr}{dt},$ is the velocity vector
	- Measure instantaneous direction of motion and the rate of change of position
___
## Examples:
___
### **1).**
- Consider $r(t) = (1+t)\hat i + 2t \hat j +3t \hat k$
	- We will see this in an example of motion along a line
- Consider $r(t)$, when $t = -1,0,1,2$
	- $r(-1) = -2\hat j - 3\hat k$
	- $r(0) \;\;\;=\hat i$
	- $r(1)\;\;\;= 2\hat i + 2\hat j + 3\hat k$
	- $r(2) \;\;\;= 3\hat i + 4\hat j + 6\hat k$  
- Also velocity is:
$$v = \dfrac{dr}{dt} = \hat i + 2\hat j + 3\hat k$$
- Notice, v is independent of time. 
	- Thus the tangent vector is constant along the path of motion
	- This is why motion is along a line
___
### **2).**
- Find velocity vector if $r(t) = t\hat i + \frac{t^{2}}{2}\hat j + \hat k$
- $v = \frac{dr}{dt} = 1\hat i + t\hat j$ ^16e984
