- Consider the motion from time *t = 0* to some later time *t*
- Let u be initial velocity
- The slop is $a = \dfrac{v-u}{t} \to v = u + at$
___ 
> [!question]- A car accelerates from 0 to 100km/h in 3.7 seconds, solve for accel.
> u = 0
> 
> v = $\dfrac{100km}{1h} = \dfrac{100\times10^3}{3600s}$
> 
> t = 3.7s
> $$a = \dfrac{v-u}{t} = 7.5m/s^2$$
