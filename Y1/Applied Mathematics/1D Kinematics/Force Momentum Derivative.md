1. **Defining Momentum (p):** 
	$\large p = mv$
1. **Calculating the Rate of Change of Momentum**: 
	$\large \dfrac{dp}{dt} = \dfrac{d}{dt}(m\cdot v)$

1. **Using the Product Rule**: 
	$\large \dfrac{dp}{dt} = m\cdot \frac{dv}{dt} + v\cdot \frac{dm}{dt}$
    
    However, the mass of an object is typically considered constant (i.e., it doesn't change with time), so $\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$, simplifying the equation to:
    
	$\large \dfrac{dp}{dt} = m\cdot \frac{dv}{dt}$


1. **Newton's Second Law**: 
	Since $\frac{dv}{dt} = a$, we can rewrite as:
	
	$\large \dfrac{dp}{dt} = m\cdot \dfrac{dv}{dt}= m\cdot a = F$
