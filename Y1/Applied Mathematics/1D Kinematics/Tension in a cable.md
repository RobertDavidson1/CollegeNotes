>[!eq] Tension = The force you use to pull the rope is the tension.
>- Tension acts in the direction of the rope or cable, away from the object applying the force.
>- Tension can vary depending on the angle at which the force is applied and the mass or resistance being lifted or pulled
>- In equilibrium, when an object is not accelerating, the tension force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force applied to it, balancing the forces.

- Consider a cable (e.g. chain), which is inextensible
	- *that is it cannot be stretched*
- Suppose a force $F$ applied at one end and a force $-F$ applied at the other

<br>
- Consider a small part of the cable (e.g. a link), which experiences a force from its neighboring parts. 
<br>
![[Pasted image 20231005142511.png | center |200]]
<br>
- Force on Link 1, due to Link 2 = F
- Force on Link 2, due to Link 1 = -F
- The cable is said to be **under tension $T$ with $T = F$**
	- That is each part, experiences a force +F and -F

## Pulley Example
- We often consider pulley systems consisting of an inextensible but flexible rope or table, wound over a smooth cylinder.
- The direction of the constant can then change

## Practice:
> [!quote] Question 1 
> > [!question]- A car of mass 1300 kg pulls a caravan of mass 700 kg. The car can produce a pulling force of 2 kN. Find the acceleration of the car and caravan.
> $$\large a = 1ms^{-2}$$

> [!quote] Question 2 
> > [!question]- A mass m1 is attached to one end of an inextensible string and another mass m2 is attached to the other end. The string passes over a smooth fixed pulley. Find the acceleration of the system under gravity.
> $$a= \left(\dfrac{m1 - m2}{m1 + m2}\right)\cdot g$$

> [!quote] Question 3 
> > [!question]- Find tension T in Question 2
> $$T = m_1(g-a) = m_1\cdot g\left(1-\dfrac{m1 - m2}{m1+m2}\right)$$
> So That
> $$T = \dfrac{2\cdot m1 \cdot m2 \cdot g}{m1+m2}$$
