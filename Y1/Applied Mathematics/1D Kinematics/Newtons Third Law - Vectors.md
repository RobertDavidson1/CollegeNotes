>- Consider two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ in interactions
>- Let the force on $m_1$ due to $m_2$ be $F_{12}$
>	- and the force on $m_2$ due to $m_1$ be $F_{21}$
>- Newton's third law in vector language states that:
>**$$ \large F_{12} = -F_{21}$$**
>- (the forces of interactions are **opposite in direction and equal in magnitude)**
