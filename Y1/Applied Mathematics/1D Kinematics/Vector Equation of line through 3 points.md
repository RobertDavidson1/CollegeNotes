## 1.) 
Find equation of line through $(1,4,-1)$ in direction of $\hat i - 3\hat k$
- Using our formula, we have:
$r = \hat i + 4\hat j -\hat k + t(\hat i - 3\hat k)$
$r = \hat i + 4\hat j - \hat k - t\hat i - 3t\hat k$
$r = \hat i + t\hat i + 4\hat j - k -3t\hat k$
$$r = (1+t)\hat i + 4j - (1+3t)\hat k$$
