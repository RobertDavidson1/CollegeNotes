___

- Let $s_1$ and $s_2$ denote the position of $m_1$ and $m_2$ along a line
- Assume again that the only forces of interaction between the particles are present over time interval $T$
- We define the position of the **centre of mass (com)** of the particles, $s_{cm}$ by,  
$$s_{cm} = \dfrac{m_1s_1 + m_2s_2}{m1+m2} = \dfrac{m_1s_1 + m_2s_2}{M}$$
			where $M = m_1+m_2$ is total mass; com gives mass avg position of two particles
<br>
___
- We denote by $p_1, p_2$ the momenta of $m_1, m_2$ respectively, so that
	- $p_1 = m_1\dot s_1$ 
	- $p_2 = m_2\dot s_2$
- Total Momentum given by:
	- $P = p_1 + p_2 = \dfrac{d}{dt}(m_1s_1 + m_2s_2) = M \cdot s_{cm}\dfrac{d}{dt} = Mv_{cm}$
	where $v_cm = \dfrac{ds_{cm}}{dt}$ is the velocity of the centre of the mass.
- But here, conservation of momentum implies that:
$$P = constant \rightarrow v_{cm} = constant$$
<br>
___
- Thus we can think of the system of two masses as being like a single  
particle of mass $M$ at the centre of mass $s_{cm}$ with velocity $v_{cm}$ = $\dot s cm$   
and momentum $P = M v_{cm}$. 
Conservation of momentum is equivalent to  $v_{cm}$ being constant.

- **Example:**
	- The collision of a moving mass $m_1$ =with a stationary mass $m_2$
	- Before the collision the $com$ velocity is $v_{cm} = \dfrac{P}{M} = \dfrac{m_1u}{m_1+m_2}$, 
	- The $com$ velocity after is $v$
