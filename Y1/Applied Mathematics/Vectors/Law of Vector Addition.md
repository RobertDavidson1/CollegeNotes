>[!eq] Law of vector addition
>In general we define the addition of two vector **$a$** and **$b$** by joining the **head of $a$ to the tail of $b$ where:**
>$$a+b =  b+a\quad\quad The\: Law\:of\:vector\:addition$$
><br>
>This law is also called the **Parallelogram Law** since any two vectors $a,b$ can be used to define a parallelogram as shown.
>The diagonal is then described by the vector $a+b = b+a$
