- Let $x = ln\;t$ and consider the graph of $x$ versus $t$
	- Notice $ln\;t$ is only defined for $t > 0$ 
<br>
- We now find the derivative of $ln\;t$
- Recall that: $$ln\;t=\int_{1}^t \frac{1}{t} dt$$
- Hence:
$$\frac{d}{dt}(ln\;t) = \frac{1}{t}$$
- **$ln \;t$ is an increasing function in $t$ and the rate of increase decreases as $t$ grows**
___
- Inspecting the graph, we see that $x$ takes all the values $- \infty < x < \infty$ and $0 < t < \infty$
- We also see that for each $x$ there is a corresponding unique $t > 0$
- We thus define the inverse function of $ln\;t$
	$$t = exp(x) \leftrightarrow x = ln(t)$$
- Called the **Exponential Function**
- Thus:
	$$exp(ln(t)) = t\quad and\quad ln(exp(x)) = x$$
<br>
- Note that $exp(x) > 0$ for $\infty < x < \infty$ and that $exp(0) = 1$
- We define a particular evaluation of $exp(x)$ at $x =1$ to be the number:
	$$ e = exp(1)$$
- i.e. $ln(e) = 1$
- $e$ is fundamental quantity in mathematics which appears in a wide variety of settings
