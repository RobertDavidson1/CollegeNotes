> - From the example in [[Integration]], recall that:
> $$\int t^n dt = \dfrac{1}{n+1}t^{n+1} + C, \quad n \ne -1$$

## But what if $n = -1?$
- We define a new function, referred to as the **Natural Logarithm** as so $$\ln(t) = \int_{1}^{t} \dfrac{1}{t} dt$$
___
## Consider the graph of $\dfrac{1}{t}$

- Then ln(t) is the *area under the curve* between $1$ and $t \ge 1$.

- Thus ln(t) behaves like a *logarithmic function.* 
- It is called the **Natural Logarithm**
- It is sometimes also denoted by *$log(t)$ or by $log_e(t)$*
- $log_{10}(t)$  denotes the usual log base 10.
