$$\large Slope = \dfrac{\triangle y}{\triangle x}$$
<br>
- We can find an **average** slope between two points
- But how do we find the slope **at a point?**
- ![[slope-0-0 1.svg |  200]]
	 - There's nothing to measure !
- But with derivatives we use a small difference 
	- Then have it **shrink towards zero**
