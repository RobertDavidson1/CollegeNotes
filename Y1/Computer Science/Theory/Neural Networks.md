- Can be built with many different python packages
	- PyTorch, Sci-kit-Learn, TensorFlow
- Neural networks are simply mathematical objects (graphs)
- **Neurons:** nodes or vertices in the graph
___
### Layers:
- Neurons are grouped in layers (left to right)
1. **Input Layer:** First 
2. **Output Layer:** Last
3. **Hidden Layers**: Everything else

___
- **Tunable Parameters:** the weights, which is an edge of a note
- Each neuron is a *value* and a *mathematical function*
	- It sums together all incoming nodes (multiplied by the weights)
	- Applied the function
	- Output is the value for the neuron
- **Learns:** through significant number of trial and errors
