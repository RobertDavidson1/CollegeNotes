$$\LARGE \left(2+(-1)^n \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\right)^\infty_{n=1}$$

____
- As n gets very large, $\large \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$, gets very small
	- By taking n to be very large, we can make it as small as we like
- Hence for very large values of $n$ the number is very close to $2$
- By taking $n$ as large as we like, we can make this number as close to $2$ as we like
- We say that the sequence **converges** to $2$, or that $2$ is the *limit* of the sequence
- So we write:
$$\LARGE \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(2+(-1)^n \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\right) = 2$$
___
- **Note:**
	- Because $(-1^n)$ is alternately positive and negative as $n$ runs through the nautral numbers
	- The terms of this sequence are alternately greater than and less than 2
