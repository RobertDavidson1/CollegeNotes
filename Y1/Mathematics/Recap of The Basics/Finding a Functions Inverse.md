## Recall from the previous reference of [[Existence of an Inverse Function| Inverse Functions]]:
- A function maps elements in the *domain of $f$ to the elements in the range of $f$*
- An inverse function maps each element **from the range of $f$ back to its element from the domain of $f$**
___
## Finding inverse function
- We need to determine which $x$ in the domain of $f$ satisfies f(x) = y
	- Since $f$ is a one-to-one function there is exactly one such value
- We can find the value $x$ by solving the equation $f(x) = y$ for $x$
	- Doing so, we are able to write $x$ as a function of $y$ where the domain of this function is the range of $f$, and the range of this function is the domain of $f$.
- Consequently, the function is the inverse of $f$, written as $x= f^{-1}(y)$
___
## Problem solving strategy:
1. Solve the equation $y = f(x) for x$
2. Interchange the variable $x and y$ and write $y=f^{-1}(x)$
___
## Example:
>[!faq]- Find the inverse for the function $f(x) = 3x-4$. State the domain and the range of the inverse function. Verify that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$
