- Recall that an integer $p > 1$ is called a **prime** if its *only divisors are 1 and p itself* 
- If $p$ is a prime and $a$ and $b$ are any integers then, 
	- either *$p$ divides $a,\;\;gcd(a,p) =1$*
	- if *$p|a\cdot b$ then $p|a$ or $p|b$*
- Prime numbers are the building blocks of the integers
- An integers $n>1$ that is not a prime is called a **composite number**
