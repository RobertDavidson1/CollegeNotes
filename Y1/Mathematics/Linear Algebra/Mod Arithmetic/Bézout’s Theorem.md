$$\large Let\; a, b,c \in \mathbb{N}$$
$$\large Then\;there\;are\;integers\;x,y\;such\;that\;$$
$$\large ax\ + \ by = gcd(a,b)$$
$$\newline$$
$$\large If\; c\; divides\;gcd(a,b)\; then$$
$$\large ax\ + \ by =c$$

- This tells us that *as long as c* divides *gcd(a,b)* we are able to find pairs of integers, such that *ax + by = c*
- Our method of back substitution from [[Remainder Theorem and Euclid's Algorithm]] gives us a practical way to compute such pair
