- Matrices with only one row/columns are also called **vectors**
$v = \begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}$
- As for matrices of other sizes, vectors can be added and multiplied
	- As long as sizes allow for that
___
$$\cases{2x+3y+z =7\cr2x+y+3z =9\cr4x+2y+5z =16}$$

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}2 & 3 & 1\\2&1&3\\4&2&5\end{pmatrix} \quad x = \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \quad B = \begin{pmatrix}7\\9\\16\end{pmatrix}$$
- Solving our system is equivalent to solving $Ax = b$
	- Can we *invert* $A$ to find $x$?...
