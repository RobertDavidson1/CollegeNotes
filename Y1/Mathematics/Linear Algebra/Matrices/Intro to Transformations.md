- Recall a function is a rule $f$, that associates with each element of a *set $X$ (domain)*, and one and only one element in a *set $Y$ (co-domain)*
- If $f$ associates with the element $b$ with the element $a$, then we write $b = f(a)$ 
	- We say that **$b$ is the image of $a$ under $f$** 
	- Or that $f(a)$ is the value of $f$ at $a$
- The subset of the co-domain that consists of all images of elements in the domain is called the **range** of $f$

- While in many applications the domain and co-domain are real numbers, here we will consider functions who's domain is *$\mathbb{R}^n$* and who's codomain is *$\mathbb{R}^m$* for some positive integers $m,n$
- We will call these functions **$transformations$**
