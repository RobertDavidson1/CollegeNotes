>- A 2-cycle is called a **transposition**.
>- Each $n$-cycle is a product of transpositions:
  $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = (x_1, x_2)(x_2, x_3) \ldots (x_{n-1}, x_n).$

>[!eq] **Theorem (Librarian's Nightmare)**
> Each permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is a product of **transpositions**

- $\pi \in S_n$ is called **even** (resp. **odd**) if it is a product of an even (resp. odd) number of transpositions.

___

>[!eq] **Fact**
> A permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is either even or odd, but **not both**.

>[!feynman] Feynman Technique
>Imagine you have a row of books, and a transposition is when you swap the positions of two books. Any arrangement of the books can be achieved by a series of such swaps. If you can swap them back to the starting position with an even number of swaps, we call this an even permutation. If it takes an odd number of swaps, it's an odd permutation. But a single arrangement of books can't be both even and odd; it's one or the other, just like you can't walk an even and an odd number of steps at the same time.
