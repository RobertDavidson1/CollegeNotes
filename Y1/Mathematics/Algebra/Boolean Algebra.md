>[!eq] **Boolean Algebra**
> - Sets (together with the operations $\cap$, $\cup$, $\setminus$, and the constants $\emptyset$, $U$) behave similarly to propositions (together with the operations $\land$, $\lor$, $\neg$, and the constants $F$, $T$).
> - Both are examples of an abstract structure (with $\cdot$, $+$, $\prime$, and $0$, $1$) called a Boolean algebra.
> - For any logical equivalence, there is a corresponding set equality, and vice versa.

>[!eq] **Duality**
> - The dual of a set equality is obtained by swapping $\cap$ with $\cup$ and swapping $\emptyset$ with $U$.
> - The dual of a valid set equality is also a valid set equality.

>Think of Boolean algebra like a game with two types of cards: set cards and proposition cards. Set cards use symbols like $\cap$, $\cup$, and have special cards like $\emptyset$ (the empty set) and $U$ (the universal set). Proposition cards use symbols like $\land$ (and), $\lor$ (or), and have special cards like $F$ (false) and $T$ (true).

>In this game, you can match a set card combination with a proposition card combination if they follow the same rules. This matching is an example of abstraction in math, where different things can follow the same general rules.
>
>Duality is like having a mirror in the game: what you see in the mirror with set cards (like swapping $\cap$ with $\cup$) you can do with proposition cards as well, and it will still make sense. It's like a reflection rule that always works.
