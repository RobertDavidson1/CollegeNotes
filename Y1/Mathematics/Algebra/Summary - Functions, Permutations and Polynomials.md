>Let's break down these points as if we were explaining them to a friend who's new to the subject:
>- Think of functions like dance moves, and when you compose them, you're putting dance moves in sequence. Associativity means that no matter how you group these moves, the end performance looks the same.
>- A permutation is like rearranging dancers on a stage; each dancer moves to a new spot, and a bijection ensures that no two dancers end up in the same spot.
>- If the dancers move in separate non-overlapping circles, that's like a product of disjoint cycles.
>- How many times the dancers go around in their circles before returning to their starting positions is the order of the permutation.
>- The sign of a permutation is like a score that keeps track of how many times pairs of dancers have switched places; an odd number of switches gives a negative score, and an even number gives a positive score.
>- All the ways you can rearrange a given set of dancers make up something called the symmetric group.
>- Polynomials can be thought of as a collection of dance routines that follow certain rules that make them a commutative ring.
>- Dividing one dance routine by another is like breaking down a complex routine into simpler steps, which is done by long division.
>- When a dance routine can't be broken down into simpler moves anymore, it's called an irreducible polynomial, and it's unique to that routine.
>- In the world of complex numbers, every solo dance move is irreducible, but in other systems, you can have duos or trios that are irreducible.
