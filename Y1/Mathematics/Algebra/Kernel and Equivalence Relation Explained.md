> When you have a function $f$ that maps elements from set $X$ to set $Y$, you can create a special kind of relationship among the elements of $X$ based on this function. This relationship, denoted by $\sim$, is saying that two elements $x$ and $x'$ from $X$ are considered related if they are mapped to the same element in $Y$ by the function $f$. In other words, $f(x)$ is equal to $f(x')$.
>
> Now, this relationship $\sim$ is what's known as an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation on a set has three key properties:
> - **Reflexivity:** Every element is related to itself.
> - **Symmetry:** If one element is related to another, then the second is related to the first.
> - **Transitivity:** If one element is related to a second, and the second is related to a third, then the first element is also related to the third.
>
> Because of these properties, you can group elements of $X$ into what are called equivalence classes. An equivalence class for an element $x$ includes all elements that are related to $x$ under $\sim$. So, the equivalence class $[x]$ is the set of all elements $x'$ in $X$ that satisfy $f(x) = f(x')$.
>
> When you take all of these equivalence classes together, they form a partition of $X$. A partition is a way of dividing a set into non-overlapping and complete subsets, where every element of the set is included in exactly one subset. This partition is denoted by $X/\sim$ and is a collection of all the equivalence classes.
>
> The term "kernel" of $f$ in this context refers to the partition created by the equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$. It's not the kernel in the sense of algebra (where it would be the set of all elements that are mapped to a neutral element like zero), but rather the kernel here is a categorization of $X$ based on the behavior of the function $f$. The kernel tells us how the function $f$ groups elements of $X$ based on the values they are mapped to in $Y$.
