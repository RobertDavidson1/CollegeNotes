>[!eq] Definition
>- A set of elements and  an operation that combines any two elements for form another element within the same set.

>[!eq] The Four Fundamental Properties
>1. **Closure:** 
>	- For any two elements in the set, the operation applied to a and b must also produce an element in the same set
>	- *e.g.$\; a \ast b$*
>3. **Associativity:** 
>	- For any three elements $a, b,$ and $c$ in the set, the equation below is always true
>	- *$(a∗b)∗c=a∗(b∗c)$*
>- **Identity Element**: 
>	- For any element $a$ in the set there exists an element $e$ in the set, known as the identity element, 
>	- such that for any element aa in the set, the equation *$e∗a=a∗e=a$* holds. 
>	- The operation of any element with the identity element leaves it unchanged.
>- **Inverse Element**:
>	- For every element $a$ in the set, there exists another element $b$ in the same set, known as the inverse of $a$, 
>	- Such that *$a∗b=b∗a=ea∗b=b∗a=e$*

>[!eq] Example
>- Integers under addition
>	- $\set{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots}$
>	- **Closure**: The sum of any two integers is an integer.
>	- **Associativity**: Addition of integers is associative.
>	- **Identity Element**: The number 0 acts as the identity element because adding 0 to any integer does not change its value
>	- **Inverse Element**: For every integer aa, there exists an integer $-a$ such that $a+(−a)=0$a

>[!eq] Non Example:
>- The set of natural numbers $(1,2,3,\dots 1,2,3, \dots)$ under addition does not form a group  
>- It lacks an inverse element for each of its elements.
