>[!eq] **Relations are Sets**
> - A **relation** from a domain $X$ to a codomain $Y$ is a subset $R \subseteq X \times Y$.

>[!eq] **Notation**
> - We write $xRy$ (and say “$x$ is related to $y$”) for $(x, y) \in R$.

>[!eq] **Properties of Relations**
> - Let $R$ be a relation on $X$, i.e., $R \subseteq X \times X$.
> - $R$ is **reflexive** if $xRx$ for all $x \in X$.
> - $R$ is **symmetric** if $xRy$ then $yRx$ for all $x, y \in X$.
> - $R$ is **transitive** if $xRy$ and $yRz$ then $xRz$, for all $x, y, z \in X$.
> - A relation $R \subseteq X \times X$ that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an **equivalence relation**.

>[!feynman] Feynman Technique
>Think of a relation as a friendship between two people. If you have a group of people and a list of who is friends with whom, that's like a set of relations.
>- Being **reflexive** is like saying everyone is their own friend.
>- A relation is **symmetric** if whenever person A is friends with person B, person B is also friends with person A.
>- It's **transitive** if whenever person A is friends with person B, and person B is friends with person C, then person A is friends with person C as well.

>If all these friendship rules apply, it's like saying the group forms a club where everyone is friends with each other in a way that respects all these rules. This club is what we call an equivalence relation.
