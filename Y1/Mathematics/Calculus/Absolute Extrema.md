>- Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be a functioned defines on a set D (usually the domain of $f$)
>- Then $f$ has an absolute **(or global) maximum** at a point $c$ in $D$ *if $f(x) \leq f(c)$ for all $x \in D$*
>- Similarly $f$ has an absolute or **global minimum** at $c$ in $D$ if **$f(x) \geq f(c)$ for all $x \in D$*

## Example:
> [!eq] $\\$
> - Let $f(x) = x^2$
> - Then $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
> - Also $f(0) = 0$
> - Thus $f$ has an absolute minimum value, 0, at $x = 0$

> [!eq] $\\$
> - Let $f(x) = x3.$ 
> - Then $f (x)$ has no absolute maximum nor minimum on its domain R 
> 	- (no local max or min: look at the graph again).
