> Integration can be used to find areas, volumes, central points and many useful things. But it is easiest to start with finding the **area between a function and the x-axis** like this:

## Slices
- We could calculate the function at a few points and ad up slices of width $\triangle x$ like this (but the answer won't be very accurate)
- We can make $\triangle x$ a lot smaller and add up small slices
- As slices **approach 0 in width**, the answer approaches the true answer
- We now write $dx$ to mean $\triangle x$ slices are approaching zero in width

## That is a lot of adding up!
- We don't have to add them up, because there's a shortcut because:
- **finding an integral is the reverse finding a derivative**
