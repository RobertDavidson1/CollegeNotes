>[!eq] Increasing or Decreasing test
>- A function $f :\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is increasing on an interval if some x value $x_1 >$ some subsequent $x2$ 
>- That is a function is increasing if: 
>	- $f(x1) > f(x2)$ for all $x1, x2$ in the interval
>- Conversely a function is decreasing if:
>	- $f(x1) < f(x2)$ for all $x1, x2$ in the interval
