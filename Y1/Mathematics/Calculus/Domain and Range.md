### Domain
- The set of **all real numbers** (a), such that f(a) **has a solution** *(defined)*
	- e.g. f(x) = x², domain = **all of R**:
		- a² is defined for all a in |R
	- e.g. <span class='purple'>f(x) = 1/x</span>, domain =  **R \\ {0}**
		- Domain is not all of R, when x = 0, f(x) is undefined (no solution)
		- However, 1/a is defined for all R when a != 0

---
### Range
- The set of valid y values for f
- Remember, given x in domain of f, there can be only 1 f(x)
---
###  Finding Domain and Range
- The rule given
- The graph of the function
1. *f(x) = 3x² + 3*
	- Domain = R
	- Since x >= 0 for all x ∈ R, **x² + 3 >= 3**
	- Range = \[3,∞]
2. *y = sin(x)*
	- Domain = R
	- Range = \[-1,1], i.e. all y such that -1<= y <= 1
3. f(x) = tan(x)
	- *tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)*
	 - Undefined when cos x is 0
		 - i.e. when x is an odd multiple of π/2
	- Domain = R \ {(2k +1) * π/2}
		- All real numbers except..., k ∈ Z
	- Range = R
4. *y = √4 - x²*
	 - Domain = all x² <= 4
	 
	 - Range = [0,2]
		  - Since x² <= 4, if and only if -2 <= x <= 2,
