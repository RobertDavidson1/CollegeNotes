>[!eq] **Definition**
>- If the graph of $f$ lies **above** all its tangents on an interval then the graph is called **concave up.** 
>- If the graph lies **below** all its tangents then its called **concave down** 

___
**Observation:**
- If $f'' >0$ on an interval then, because its derivative is positive, the function $f'$ is increasing
	- The slopes of tangent lines are increasing $\to$ concave up
- This leads to the **concavity test**
___
**Concavity Test**
- If $f'' > 0$ on an interval then $f$ is concave up on that interval
- If $f'' < 0$ on an interval then $f$ is concave down on that interval
___
- A point $c$ where the concavity of $f$ changes, it is called an inflection point.
- By the concavity test, at an inflection point the sign of $f''$ changes (positive to negative or vice versa)
- By the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]], if **$f''$ has an inflection point at $c$** and $f''$ is continuous on an interval containing $c$, then $f''(c) = 0$
