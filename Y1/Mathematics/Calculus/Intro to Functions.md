We deal with **real numbers** when looking at functions, 
	- that is, __positive, negative, rational, irrational__ and __0__
	- These real numbers are denoted **|R**
- A *function*, f: |R -> |R is a set (S), of ordered pairs (a,b) 
	- where a,b ∈ |R
	- These pairs have the property that:
		 <span class='red'>1. If (a,b) is an element of S
		2. And (a,c) is an element of S
		3. Then b =c
		</span>
	- Then, f(a) = b if and only if, (a,b) ∈ S
- A function, where y = f(x), defines a **rule** for assigning:
	- A real number y *(dependent variable)*
	- To each element x *(independent variable)*
