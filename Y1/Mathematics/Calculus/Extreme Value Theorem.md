>[!eq] **Extreme Value Theorem**
>A function continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in $[a, b].$

- Note: Absolute extrema are local extrema, so by Fermatâ€™s theorem they occur at  critical points

___
## Method to find the absolute extrema of a continuous function $f$ on  a closed interval $[a,b]$
1. Find all critical points of $f$
2. For each critical point $c$, find $f(c)$
3. Determine $f(a)$ and $f(b)$
4. The greatest function value found in steps 2 + 3 = absolute maximum
5. The least value value in steps 2 + 3 = absolute minimum

## Example:
> [!eq] $\\$
> - Let $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 1$. Find the absolute extrema of $f$ on $[-\frac{1}{2}, 4]$
> **Solution:**
> 1. $f'(x)$ is defined everywhere so the critical points are where $3x^2 - 6x = 3x(x-2) = 0$ i.e. $x = 0, x = 2$
> 2. $f(0) = 1$ and $f(2) = -3$
> 3. $f(-1/2) = \frac{1}{8}$ and $f(4) = 17$
> 4. We see that, from the above answers:
> 	- Absolute Minimum = $-3$ at $x = 2$
> 	- Absolute Maximum = $17$ at $x =4$
