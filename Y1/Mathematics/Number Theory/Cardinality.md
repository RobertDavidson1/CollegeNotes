#### Cardinality of finite set: 
- Defined by number of elements in it
- Two sets have the same cardinality  if there exists a bijective relationship between them

#### Cardinality of infinite set:
- Two sets have the same cardinality if *and only if* it is possible to match each element of A to an element of B, so that each element of each set as one partner
