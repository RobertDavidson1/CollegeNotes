>[!eq] **Supremum Definition**

>>[!eq] Simply:

>- Then the set of *all lower bounds* for $S$ has a maximum element
>- This number is called the **infimum** of $S$
>	- Denote $\inf(S)$
>>[!eq] **Simply**
>>- The elements of $\mathbb{R}$ that are $\leq$ every element of $S$ the **set of all lower bounds for $S$**
>>- The *infimum* is the maximum element in that set

___
- The **supremum** of $S$ is also called the *least upper bound (lub)* of $S$
- The **infimum** of $S$ is also called the *greatest lower bound (glb)* of $S$
