>___
>1. $\mathbb{Z} \cap [1,3] = \set{1,2,3}$ Cardinality is 3
>2.  $\mathbb{Z} \cap (1,3) = \set{2}$  Cardinality is 1
>3. $\set{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3}$ Cardinality is 7
>4. $\set{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}$ Cardinality is 8
>5. $x^4-1 = (x^2-1)(x^2+1) = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)$
>	- The solution for $x^2+1$ does not have Real Solution
>	- $x-1$ and $x+1$ do, $(1$ and $-1)$
>	- Cardinality is 2
