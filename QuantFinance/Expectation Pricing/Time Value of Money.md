- Suppose a coin game took place at the end of a year but payment had to be made at the start of the year
- Well, we may make/lose $1$ USD, 
- **But the value of a dollar in December may not be worth a dollar now**
	- Interest rates are the formal acknowledgement of this
		- Reflect the time value of money, determining the present worth of [[future cash flows.]]
	- Bonds are the market derived from this
		- Bonds are issued by entities to raise funds, promising repayment with interest over time
- We could assume the existence of a market for these future promises, the prices quoted for these bonds being structured, derivable from some interest rate

>[!eq] Specifically:
>- We assume that for any time $T$ less than some time horizon $\tau$
>- The value now, of a dollar promised at time $T$ is given by $\exp(-rT)$ for some constant $r>0$
>- The rate $r$ is then the continuously compounded interest rate for this period
