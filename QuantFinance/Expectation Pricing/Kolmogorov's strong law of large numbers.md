>[!eq] Definition
>- Suppose we have a sequence of independent random numbers
>- $X_1, X_2, X_2$ and so on, all sampled from the same distribution which has mean (expectation) $\mu$ 
>- We let $S_n$ be the arithmetical average of the sequence up to the $n$th term
>- That is:
>$$S_n = \dfrac{(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n)}{n} $$
>- Then, with probability one, as $n$ gets larger the value of $S_n$ tends towards the mean $\mu$ of the distribution

 - In other words, if we have a coin flip game where:
	 - Heads = +0.5 USD
	 - Tails = -0.5 USD
 - After one flip, we might lose 1 USD, after another we might lose again
 - But with enough flips, we leave the game neutral
