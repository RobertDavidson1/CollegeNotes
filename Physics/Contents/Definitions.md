### Waves and Their Properties

- **Transverse waves**: Displacement perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Examples: waves on a rope, electromagnetic waves.
- **Longitudinal waves:** Displacement parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Examples: sound waves, spring compressions.
- **Periodic waves:** Wave motions where waves repeat themselves.
- **Amplitude (A):** Maximum excursion of a particle of the medium from the particle's undisturbed position.
- **Wavelength (λ):** Horizontal length of one cycle of the wave.
- **Period (T):** Time taken to complete one cycle.
- **Electromagnetic waves:** Transverse waves that travel through a vacuum at the speed of light.
- **Polarization:** When the oscillations of a transverse wave are restricted to one direction.
- **Inverse Square Law:** intensity of a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity.

### Sound and Hearing

- **Pitch:** How the brain interprets frequency; lower frequency means lower pitch.
- **Fundamental frequency:** The lowest frequency produced by the whole of an object.
- **Harmonic Frequency:** Multiples of the fundamental frequency.
- **Pure Tone:** Sound with a single frequency.
- **Hearing:** Perception of sound.
- **Loudness:** Subjective quantity related to amplitude.
- **Infrasonic / Infrasound:** Frequencies below 20 Hz.
- **Ultrasonic / Ultrasound:** Frequencies above 20 kHz.
- **Sound intensity (I):** The power that passes perpendicularly through a surface divided by the area of that surface.
- **Doppler Effect:** Change in frequency of sound detected by an observer due to relative motion between the sound source and observer.

### Electrical Properties and Phenomena
- **Electric Potential:** Amount of work energy needed per unit of electric charge to move the charge from a reference point to a specific point
- **Electrical Power:** the rate of transfer of electrical energy within a circuit

- **Positive charge:** Losing an electron (atom becomes a positive ion).
- **Negative charge:** Gaining an electron (atom becomes a negative ion).
- **Law of Conservation of Electric Charge:** The total charge is constant in any process.
- **Electrostatic force:** Force stationary charges exert on each other.
- **Electrical Conductors:** Materials that readily allow electric charge to move through them.
- **Coulombs Law:** Magnitude of electrostatic force exerted by one point charge ($q_1$) on another point charge $(q_2)$ separated by a distance $r$ is: $F = k\dfrac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}$
- **Electrical Insulators:** Materials that conduct electric charge poorly.
- **Electric dipole:** A pair of charges of the same magnitude but opposite sign.
- **Dipole moment:** Magnitude of electric dipole field is proportional to q×dq×d, where q is charge, d is distance.
- **Electrostatic Equilibrium:** No net movement of electric charge.
- **Voltage:** Electric potential difference between two points.
- **Electron Volt:** Magnitude of work done when an electron is moved through a potential difference of 1 volt.
- **Equipotential Surface:** Surface where the electric potential is the same everywhere.
- **Capacitor:** A device used to store electric charge.
- **Dielectric Material:** Insulator put between two metal plates in a capacitor.
- **Electric Circuits:** When charge flows through a closed path and returns to the starting point.
- **Direct Current (DC):** Charges travel around the circuit in one direction (battery).
- **Alternating Current (AC):** The direction of flow of charge reverses periodically (mains).
- **Electric Current (A):** Flow of charge from one place to another (Amperes).
- **Resistance:** Impedance of the flow of current (Ohms).
- **Superconductors:** A material whose resistivity is zero.
- **Kirchhoff's Current Law (Junction Rule):** The sum of all currents entering a junction equals the sum of all currents leaving the junction.
- **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (Loop Rule):** Sum of all potential rises around any closed circuit loop equals the sum of all potential drops.

### Optical Phenomena

- **Focal length (f):** Distance between the pole of the mirror and the focal point.
- **Law of reflection:** The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface all lie in the same plane, and the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence (θr=θiθr​=θi​).
- **Specular Reflection:** Occurs off smooth, mirror-like surfaces.
- **Diffuse Reflection:** Occurs off non-smooth surfaces.
- **Refractive index:** Ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in material.
- **Real image:** Occurs where rays converge; can be produced by concave mirrors and converging lenses.
- **Virtual image:** Occurs when rays diverge; can be produced with the help of a convex mirror or diverging lens.
- **Concave / Converging Mirror:** Reflecting surface that is recessed inward.
- **Convex / Diverging Mirror:** Reflective surface bulges outwards.
- **Converging Lens:** Causes parallel rays to converge.
- **Diverging lens:** Causes parallel rays to diverge.
- **Chromatic Aberration:** Blue lights get refracted more than red.
- **Spherical Aberration:** Rays farther from the optic axis are over-refracted.
- **Coma:** Off-axis rays not properly focused.

### General Physics Principles

- **Principle of Linear Superposition:** The resultant disturbance is the sum of the disturbances from the individual waves.
- **Interference:** Net effect of combining two waves on coinciding paths
- **Constructive Interference:** When crests and troughs of two waves align.
- **Destructive Interference:** When the peak of one wave aligns with the trough of another.
- **Coherent:** Wave patterns do not shift relative to one another.
- **Resonance:** An external force causes another system to vibrate with greater amplitude at a specified frequency.
- **Beat Frequency:** Difference between two sound frequencies.
- **Nodes:** Where the amplitude of disturbance is zero.
- **Antinodes:** Where the amplitude of disturbance is greatest.
- **Magnetism:** Magnetic field caused by moving charges.
- **Magnetic Force:** Force causing like poles to repel, opposite poles to attract.
- **Magnetic Field:** Force field surrounding a magnet.
