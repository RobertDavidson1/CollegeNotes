- **Focal length $f$:** distance between the pole of the mirror and focal point
- **Law of reflection:** 
	-  The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the surface all lie in the same plane
	- The angle of reflection is equal to angle of incidence ($\theta_r = \theta_i$)
- **Specular Reflection:**
	- Occurs off smooth, mirror like surfaces
	- Parallel incident rays are reflected as parallel reflected rays
- **Diffuse Reflection:**
	- Occurs off non-smooth surfaces (water)
	- Parallel indecent rays are reflected at angle perpendicular to the surface, but rays are reflected randomly, because orientation of surface varies
___
#### Types of Mirrors:
- **Laws of Reflection in Mirrors**
	- Paraxial rays are incident rays that are parallel to principal axis (PA)
	- Paraxial rays are reflected through focal point of mirror
	


___
### Rules:
- **Concave Mirrors:**
	- Rays that are parallel to the PA are reflected through F
	- Rays that pass through F are reflected parallel to the PA (reverse of rule 1)
	- Rays that pass through C are reflected straight back
- **Convex:**
	- Ray parallel to PA reflected through F
	- Ray going through F reflected parallel to PA
	- Ray striking centre of mirror reflected at same angle as incident ray

___
**Focal length of different mirrors**
	$$f_{concave} = \dfrac{R}{2}\quad\quad f_{convex} = \dfrac{-R}{2}$$

**Plane Mirror:**
$$\begin{align}&|d_o| = |di|\\\\ &d_0 = -di\\\\&m = \dfrac{h_i}{h_0}\end{align}$$

**Concave Mirror:**
$$\begin{align}&|d_o| = |di|\\\\ &\dfrac{1}{f} = \dfrac{1}{d_o} + \dfrac{1}{d_i}\\\\&m = \dfrac{h_i}{h_0}=-\dfrac{d_i}{d_o}\end{align}$$
