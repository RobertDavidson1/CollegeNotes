- **Electric Circuits:** when charge flows through a closed path and returns to starting point
- **Direct Current:** charges travel around circuit in one direction (battery)
- **Alternating Current:** direction of flow of charge reverses periodically (mains)
- **Electric Current: (A):** flow of charge from one place to another (Amperes)
- **Resistance:** impedance of flow of current (Ohms)
- **Superconductors:**  a material  who's resistivity is zero.

___
##### Resistivity:
- Different materials are more or less resistant than others
- *Metals:* resistivity increases with increasing temperature:
	- more vigorous vibrations of materials means current is impeded more
- *Superconductors:* resistivity decreases with increasing temperatures
	- more electrons are able to break free from atoms, increased current

___


___
**Resistors in series:**
$$R_s = R_1 + R_2 + \dots$$

**Resistors in parallel:**
$$\dfrac{1}{R_p} = \dfrac{1}{R_1}+\dfrac{1}{R_2}+\dots$$

**Capacitors in series:**
$$\dfrac{1}{C_s} = \dfrac{1}{C_1}+\dfrac{1}{C_2}+\dots$$

**Capacitors in Parallel:**
$$C_p = C_1+C_2+\dots$$

**Electric Current:**
$$I = \dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

**Resistance:**
$$V = IR$$

**Resistivity:**
$$R = \rho \dfrac{L}{A}\quad\begin{align*}&L:\text{Length of mateiral}\\&A: \text{Cross sectional area}\\&\rho: \text{resistivity of material}\end{align*}$$

**Power to a device:**
$$P = IV \quad\begin{align*}&P:\text{Power delivered (Watts)}\\&I:\text{Electric current (Amps)}\\&V:\text{Electric Potential (Volts)}\end{align*}$$

**Electric Power:**
$$P = IV = I^2R$$
$$P= \dfrac{V^2}{R}  $$

**AC Current:**
$$V = V_0 \sin(2\pi ft)\quad\begin{align*}&V_0:\text{Peak voltage}\\&f:\text{frequency of signal (Hz)}\\&t:\text{Time (s)}\end{align*}$$
**AC if circuit is purely resistive:**
$$I = I_0 \sin(2\pi ft)\quad\begin{align*}&I_0:\text{Peak current}\\&f:\text{frequency of signal (Hz)}\\&t:\text{Time (s)}\end{align*}$$
