### Aberrations:
- **Chromatic Aberration**
	- Applies to lenses
	- Blue lights get refracted more than red
	- Does not apply to mirrors, because reflection does not reply on colour
	- *Fix:* achromatic lenses (made of materials with different n's)
- **Spherical Aberration**
	- Applies to mirrors and lenses
	- Spherical mirrors and lenses are cheap to make but is not perfect shape to form a sharp image
	- Spherical lens: rays farther from optic axis are over refracted
	- *Fix:* narrowing aperture or use parabolic mirror / cartesian oval lens
- **Coma**
	- Applies to mirrors and lenses
	- Off-axis rays not properly focused
	- Gives comet shape to stars

**Angular Size**
$$\theta = \dfrac{h_0}{d_0} = \dfrac{h_0}{N}\quad\quad\text{N: near point of eye}$$

**Angular Magnification:**
$$M=\frac{\theta^{\prime}}\theta $$

**Angular magnification of magnifying glass**
$$M\approx\left(\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{d_i}\right)N \approx \dfrac{N}{f}$$

**Angular magnification of  a compound microscope**
$$M\approx-\frac{(L-f_e)N}{f_of_e}$$

**Telescope:**
$$\theta = -\dfrac{h_i}{f_o}$$
