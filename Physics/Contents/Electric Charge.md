- **Nucleus:** compact core containing protons and neutrons
- **Electrons:** orbit the nucleus
- **Positive charge**: gaining electron (atom called a *positive ion*)
- **Negative charge:** gaining an electron (atom called *negative ion*)
- **Law of Conservation of Electric Charge:** Total charge is constant in any process
- **Electrostatic force:** force stationary charges exert on each other
- **Electrical Conductors:** materials that readily allow electric charge to move through them
- **Electrical Insulators:** materials that conduct electric charge poorly
- **Electric dipole:** pair of charges of same magnitude but opposite sign
- **Dipole moment:** magnitude of electric dipole field is proportional to $q\times d$, where q is charge, d is distance
- **Electrostatic Equilibrium:** no net movement of electric charge
- *Like charges repel, opposite charges attract*
___
##### Coulombs Law
- Magnitude of electrostatic force exerted by one point charge ($q_1$) on another point charge $(q_2)$ separated by a distance $r$ is:
$$F = k\dfrac{|q_1|\cdot|q_2|}{r^2}\quad\text{where }k = 8.99\times10^9$$

___
##### Electric Field:
- Electric field $\vec E$ at a point is the electrostatic force per unit charge experienced by a small positive test charge placed at that point
$$\large\vec E = \dfrac{\vec F}{q}$$
$$E = k\dfrac{|Q|}{r^2}\quad\begin{align*}&\text{Magnitude of field a distance r from point charge Q}\\&\text{where }k = 8.99\times10^9\end{align*}$$

- If Q is $-ve$ the force on positive charge is attractive (field point towards q)
 - If Q is $+ve$ the force on positive charge is repulsive (field point away q)
$$E = \dfrac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A}\quad\text{Electric field between plates  
in parallel plate capacito}$$

- Drawing:
	- Arrows point towards negative charges
	- Arrows point away from positive charges
	- Number of arrows should be proportional to the magnitude of the charge
