- **Focal length $f$:** distance between the pole of the mirror and focal point
- **Law of reflection:** 
	-  The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the surface all lie in the same plane
	- The angle of reflection is equal to angle of incidence ($\theta_r = \theta_i$)
- **Specular Reflection:**
	- Occurs off smooth, mirror like surfaces
	- Parallel incident rays are reflected as parallel reflected rays
- **Diffuse Reflection:**
	- Occurs off non-smooth surfaces (water)
	- Parallel indecent rays are reflected at angle perpendicular to the surface, but rays are reflected randomly, because orientation of surface varies
- **Refractive index:** ratio of speed of light in a vacuum to speed of light in material
- **Real image:** occurs where rays *converge*, can be produced by *concave mirrors and converging lenses* only if object is placed further away from mirror/lens than the focal point (this real image is inverted)
- **Virtual image:** occurs when rays *diverge*, can be produced with help of a *convex mirror or diverging lens*. (upright)
- **Concave / Converging Mirror:** reflecting surface that is *recessed* inward and *reflect light inward* to one focal point
- **Convex / Diverging Mirror:** reflective surface *bulges* outwards and *reflect light outwards* (therefore not used to focus light)
- **Converging Lens:** causes parallel rays to converge, image is located beyond F. The image is virtual and upright
- **Diverging lens:** causes parallel rays to diverge, image is located between object and lens image is virtual and upright and diminished
