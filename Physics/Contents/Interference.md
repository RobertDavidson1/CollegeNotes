- **Principle of Linear Superposition:** when two or more waves are present simultaneously at the same place, the resultant disturbance is the sum of the disturbances from the individual waves
- **Constructive Interference:** When crests and throughs of two waves align
- **Destructive Interference:** When the peak of one wave aligns with through of another
- **Coherent:** wave patterns do not shift relative to one another
- **Resonance:** an external force forces another system to vibrate with greater amplitude at a specified frequency
- **Beat Frequency:** difference between two sound frequencies
- **Nodes:** where amplitude of disturbance is 0
- **Antinodes:** where amplitude of disturbance is greatest
___
###### Standing waves
- **Tube open at both ends:** Antinode at both ends
- **Tube closed at one end and open at another:**
	- Antinode at open end
	- Node at closed end
	- Resonance is odd harmonics (1,3,5)
- **String fixed at both ends:** node at both ends


___
$f_{beat} = |f_1 - f_2| = \dfrac{1}{\text{time for one beat}}$


$f_{osc} = \dfrac{f_1+f_2}{2}$


$f_n=n\left(\dfrac v{2L}\right) = \dfrac{n}{2L}\sqrt{\dfrac{F}{m/L}},\quad n=1,2,3,4,\ldots \quad\begin{align*}&f_n:\text{nth harmonic}\\ &L:\text{Length of string}\end{align*}$

$f_n=n\left(\dfrac v{4L}\right) = nf_1,\quad n=1,3,5,\ldots$
