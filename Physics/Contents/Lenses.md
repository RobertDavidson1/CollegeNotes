### Rules:
- **Converging lens (convex)**
	- Rays parallel to PA are refracted through the focal point
	- Rays that pass through focal point are refracted parallel to PA
	- Rays that travel through centre of lens continue without refraction
- **Diverging lens (concave)**
	- Rays parallel to PA are refracted away from PA, appearing to have originated at focal point
	- Rays travelling towards focal point are refracted parallel to PA
	- Rays that travel through centre of lens continue on same path without refraction

**Thin Lens Formula**
$$\dfrac{1}{d_o} = \dfrac{1}{f} - \dfrac{1}{d_i}$$
