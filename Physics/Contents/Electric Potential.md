- **Voltage:** electric potential between two points
- **Electron Volt:** magnitude of work done when an electron is moved through a potential difference of 1 volt
- **Equipotential Surface:** surface where the electric potential is the same everywhere
- **Capacitor:** a device used to store electric charge
- **Dielectric Material:** insulator put in between two metal plates in capacitor


___

$$V = \dfrac{EPE}{Q}\quad\quad\quad\begin{align*}&V:\text{Electric Potential}\\&EPE: \text{Electic Potential Energy}\\&Q:\text{Charge (Coloumbs)}\end{align*}$$

___

**Work Done moving a particle across a potential difference**
$$W = qV$$

**Potential difference between two points in terms of work done moving charge**
$$\Delta V = V_B - V_A = -\dfrac{W_{AB}}{q}$$


**Electric Potential $V$ a distance $r$ from an isolated point charge $Q$**
$$V = \dfrac{kQ}{r}= \dfrac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\cdot\dfrac{Q}{r}$$

**Relationship between  Electric Field (E) and Electric Potential**
$$W_{AB} = qE\Delta s$$
$$E = \dfrac{\Delta V}{\Delta s}$$

**Capacitance**
$$Q = CV \quad\begin{align*}&Q: \text{magnitude of stored charge}\\ &C:\text{Capacitance}\\&V:\text{Potential difference between two plates}\end{align*}$$

**Energy Stored in a Capacitor**
$$Energy = \dfrac{1}{2}CV^2$$
