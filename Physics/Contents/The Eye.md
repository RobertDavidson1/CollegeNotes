>**Myopia: (near)**
>- Near-sighted myopic eye converges rays from a distant object *in front of retina (overfocusing)*
>- Thus rays diverge before striking the retina, producing blurry image
>- **Causes:** Lens too powerful, length of eye too great
>- **Correction:** Diverging (concave) lens

>**Hyperopia: (far)**
>- Eye is unable to converge rays from a close object *before they strike retina, image forms before retina*
>- **Causes** by lens being too weak, or length of eye being too short
>- **Correction:** Converging (convex) lens
