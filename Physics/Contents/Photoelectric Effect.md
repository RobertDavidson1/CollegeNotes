- Light consist of photons and comes from a phenomenon called the *photoelectric effect*
- Changing the frequency of light to be higher, increased energy on ejected electrons 

**Photon Energy**
$$E = hf \quad\text{Where h: planks constant }(6.626 \times 10^{-34})$$

**Photoelectric Effect:**
>[!eq] Eisenstein:
>- When light shines on a metal, a photon can give up its energy to an electron in that metal
>- The *minimum energy* required to remove the lost strongly held electrons is called the **Work Function**
>
>**Equation:**
>$$hf = KE_{max} + W_o$$
>- Where 
>	- hf : photon energy
>	- KE_max: maximum ke of ejected photon
>	- Wo: minimum work needed
