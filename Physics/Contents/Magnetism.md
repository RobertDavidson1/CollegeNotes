- **Magnetism:** magnetic field caused by moving charges
- **Magnetic Force:** force causing like poles to repel, opposite poles to attract
- **Magnetic Field:** force field surround a magnet (T : Tesla)


**Force on a moving charge:**
- If B and v are in same direction , force is 0
- Force is perpendicular to v and B

$$\vec F = Bqv\sin\theta \quad\begin{align*}&F:\text{Manetic force}\\&B:\text{Magnetic field}\\&q:\text{Electric charge}\\&v:\text{velocity of moving charge}\\&\theta:\text{angle between B + velocity of moving charge}\end{align*}$$


**Electrons move in circular path:**
$$r = \dfrac{mv}{Bq}$$

**Force on a current carrying wire**
$$F = BIL\sin\theta$$
