- **Complement $(\overline E)$:** Of an event $E$ in a sample space $S$ is the set $S \backslash E$
- **Disjoint:** If $E$ and $F$ cannot occur at the same time
- **Independent:** If the occurrence of $E$ is not influenced by the occurrence of $F$

>[!eq] Complement Rule:
>$P(E) + P(\overline E) = 1$ for any event $E$

>[!eq] Multiplication Rule:
>- If $E$ and $F$ are independent events then $P(E\; \&\;F) = P(E) \cdot P(F)$

>[!eq] Addition Rule:
>- If $E$ and $F$ are disjoint events then:
>	- $P(E \; or \; F) = P(E) + P(F)$
