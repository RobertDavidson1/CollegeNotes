- A sequence $(a_n)$ is called increasing if $a_n\leq a_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq1.$ 
- A sequence $(a_n)$ is called strictly increasing if $a_n<a_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq1.$
- A sequence $(a_n)$ is called decreasing if $a_n\geq a_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq 1.$
- A sequence $(a_n)$ is called strictly decreasing if $a_n>a_{n+1}$ for all $n\geq1.$

>[!eq] Definition
>- A sequence is called monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing

>[!eq] Examples:
>1. An increasing sequence is bounded below but need to be bounded above
>	$$\large (n)_{n=1}^\infty: 1,2,3,\dots$$
>2. A bounded sequence need not be monotonic:
>	- $((-1)^n) : -1,1,-1,1,-1,\dots$
>3. A convergent sequence need not be monotonic
>	- $\left(\dfrac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\right)_{n=1}^\infty: -1,-1/2,1/3,-1/4$
>4. A monotonic sequence need not be convergent

___
- However if a sequence is *bounded* and *monotonic* it is convergent
- This is the *[[Monotone Convergence Theorem]]*
