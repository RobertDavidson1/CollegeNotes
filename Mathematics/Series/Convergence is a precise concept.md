**Remark:** The notion of a convergent sequence is sometimes described informally with words like:
- "The terms gets closer and closer to $L$ as $n$ gets larger"
- It is not true however, that the terms in a sequence that converges, get progressively to $L$ as $n$ increases

>$a_n$ is defined by:
>- $a_n = 0 \;\text{if n is even}\quad a_n = \frac{1}{n}\;\text{if n is odd}$
>- Like so:
> $$\Large 1,0,\frac{1}{3},0,\frac{1}{5},0,\frac{1}{7},0$$
> - It converges to $0$ although, not every step takes us closer to $0$
