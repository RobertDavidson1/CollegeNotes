- No matter how small $\large \epsilon$ is
- We'll reach a point, as we progress up the number line, 
- Where all points will fall in the band
	- No points will deviate from $L$ greater than $\large \epsilon$

- No matter how small we choose to epsilon, as long as we continue to progress up the number line, the points will fall of distance $\epsilon$ of our number $L$
