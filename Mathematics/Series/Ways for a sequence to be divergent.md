- Being convergent is a very strong property for a sequence to have
- There are lots of ways for a sequence to be divergent 
___
>[!eq] *Oscillation*
>$$\Large (max\set{{-1}^n,0})^\infty_{n=1} : 0,1,0,1,0,1$$
>- This sequence alternates between 0 and 1, and does not approach any limit

>[!eq] *Towards $\pm \infty$*
>$$\Large (2^n)^\infty_{n=1}  : 2,4,8,16,32,64,128$$

>[!eq] *No pattern*
>- A sequence can have haphazard terms that follow no overall pattern
>- Such as the sequence whos $nth$ term is the $nth$ digit in $\pi$
