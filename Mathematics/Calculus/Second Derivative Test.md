>[!eq] **Definition**
>- An alternative to the first derivative test to classify a critical point as a max or min. 
>___
>- If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) > 0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$
>- If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) < 0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$
>- If $f'(c) = f''(c)=0$ then the second derivative test fails.
>___
>**Justification:**
>- $f''(c) > 0 \Rightarrow f'$ increasing
>	- As $x$ increases, slopes of tangent lines are going from $-$ through 0, then to $+$ and increasing
>	- Cup shaped graph with local min at $c$
>	- Other part of the test is similarly justified
