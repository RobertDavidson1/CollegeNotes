- Now consider tangents at all points $(a,f(a))$  on the graph of $y = f(x)$
- That is, after replacing $a$ above by $x$, we see that for each point $(x,f(x))$ on the graph, there is a tangent with slope:
$$\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x+h) -f(x)}{h}$$
- This defines a new function of x, denoted by $f'(x)$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$

## Examples:
> [!faq]- Let $f(x) = x^2.$ Find $f'(x)$. Compare the graphs of $f$$ and $f'$
> $$\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{h}$$
> $$\lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{x^2 - 2xh + h^2 - x^2}{h}$$
> $$\lim_{h\to 0}\dfrac{2xh + h^2}{h}$$
> $$\lim_{h\to0}(2x+h) = 2x$$
> <br>
> - Therefore:
> $$f'(x) = 2x$$
