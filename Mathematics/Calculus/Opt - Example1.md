>- A farmer wishes to fence off a rectangular area that borders a river (no fencing needed on that side). He has 2400 ft of fencing available. 
>- What are the dimensions of the field that will have the largest area?
>___
>- Let the side length of the rectangle be *$x, y$*, where we have two lengths $x$ and one length $y$, as so:

> - Total length of fencing available $= 2400 = 2x +y$
> 	- Thus: $y = 2400-2x$
> - The area enclosed (A), is $xy$
> 	- $xy = x(2400-2x) = 2400x-2x^2$
> - **Maximum of $A$ occurs at a critical points:**
> 	- $\frac{dA}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}(2400x-2x^2)=2400-4x$
> 	- Thus a single critical points where $4x = 2400\rightarrow x = 600$
> - **Ensuring this yields a maximum of $A$:**
> 	- second derivative is $\frac{d^2A}{dx^2} = -4$
> 	- This is negative so the second derivative test tells us $x=600$ yields a  maximum of A
> ___
> As a result, the farmer should choose dimensions $600ft \times 1200ft$ for a maximum possible area  of $720,000 ft^2$
