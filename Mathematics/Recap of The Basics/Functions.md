>[!eq] ## Functions
>- A functions consists of 3 things:
>1. A domain $X$ 
>2. Codomain $Y$
>3. A Rule $f \subseteq X\times Y$, so that $\forall x \in X, f(x)=y\in Y$

>[!eq] **Injective, Surjective and Bijective**
>- **Injective:** $\forall a,b \in X$, if $a\neq b\Rightarrow f(a)\neq f(b)$ 
>	- Each unique point in x maps to a unique point in y
>- **Surjective:** $\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X, f(x) =y$
>	- For every point in Y, there exists at least one X
>	- **All points in codomains are mapped to at least one X**
>- **Bijective:** 
>	- Every point in X is mapped to atmost and atleast one point in Y
