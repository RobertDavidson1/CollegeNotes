- As we've seen, $f(x) = x^2$ does not have an inverse function because its not one-to-one, as seen by the [[Horizontal Line Test]]
- However we can choose *a subset of the domain of $f$ such that the function is one-to-one.*
	- The subset is called a **restricted domain**
___
## How to restrict the domain:
- We can define a new function $g$ such that the domain of $g$ is the restricted domain of $f$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$.
- Then we can define an inverse function for $g$ on that domain
___
## Example:
- Since $f(x) = x^2$ is a one to one on the interval $[0,\infty)$, we can define, we can define $g$ such that it's domain is $[0,\infty]$, making $g$ a one - to - one function
- $g$'s inverse is then given by $g^{-1} = \sqrt{x}$

- One the other hand, the function $f(x) = x^2$ is also a one-to-one function on the domain $(\infty,0]$, therefore we could define a new function $h$ such that the domain is  $(\infty,0]$
- Therefore, the inverse of $h$ is given by $h^{-1}(x) = -\sqrt x$
