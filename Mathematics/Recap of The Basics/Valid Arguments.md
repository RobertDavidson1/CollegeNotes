>[!eq] ## Validating Arguments:
>- **Argument:** list of statements ending in a conclusion
>- The logical form of an argument can be abstracted from its content
>>[!eq] **Definition**
>>Formally, an argument structure is a list of statements $p1,p2,\dots,p_n,\therefore c$ starting with **premises $p1,p2,\dots,p_n,$** and ending in a **conclusion $c$**
>- An argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises
>- Validity of arguments depends only on the form, not on the content
>- The argument structure $p1, p2,\dots,p_2, \therefore  c$ is valid if the proposition is a **tautology** otherwise it is invalid.

>[!eq] ## Testing Argument Validity
>1. Identify the premises and the conclusion of the argument
>2. Construct a truth table showing the truth values of all premises and conclusion
>3. A critical row is a row in which all premises are true
>4. If the conclusion is true in every critical row then the argument is valid
>5. If there is a critical row in which conclusion is false, then its possible for an argument to have a false conclusion, despite true premises.
