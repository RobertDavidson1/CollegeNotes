>[!eq] Definition
>- A set equipped with two operations: addition and multiplication.
>- These operations must satisfy certain properties.

>[!eq] The Fundamental Properties
>1. **Addition**:
>	- Closed under addition. For any two elements $a$ and $b$, $a + b$ is in the set.
>	- Associative. $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.
>	- Additive identity. Exists an element $0$ such that $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$.
>	- Additive inverse. For every $a$, exists $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.
>2. **Multiplication**:
>	- Closed under multiplication. For any two $a$ and $b$, $a \times b$ is in the set.
>	- Associative. $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$.
>3. **Distributive Properties**:
>	- Left and right distribution. $a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)$ and $(b + c) \times a = (b \times a) + (c \times a)$.

>[!eq] Note on Commutativity
>- A ring is **commutative** if $a \times b = b \times a$ for all $a, b$.

>[!eq] Example
>- The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with usual addition and multiplication forms a commutative ring.
>	- It satisfies all properties, including commutativity for both operations.

>[!eq] Non-Example:
>- The set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ (excluding zero) under usual addition and multiplication does not form a ring.
>   - While it satisfies closure under addition and multiplication, and associativity for both operations,
>   - It lacks an additive identity (0 is not in $\mathbb{N}$ as defined here) and additive inverses (no natural number added to another gives zero, which is necessary for the existence of additive inverses).
