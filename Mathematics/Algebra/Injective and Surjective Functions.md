>[!eq] **Injective and Surjective Functions**
> - A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is called **surjective** (or onto) if, for every $y \in Y$, there is at least one $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
> - A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is called **injective** (or one-to-one) if, for every $y \in Y$, there is at most one $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
> - A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is called **bijective** (or a one-to-one correspondence) if it is both injective and surjective, i.e., for every $y \in Y$, there is a unique $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
> - A function is injective/surjective/bijective if it passes a suitable Horizontal Line Test.

>[!feynman] Feynman Technique
>Imagine you're at a concert, and a function is like the rule that assigns seats to ticket holders:
>- A function is **surjective** if every seat is filled; there's no empty seat. This means for every spot in the venue (every $y$), there's at least one ticket holder (some $x$) assigned to it.
>- It's **injective** if no two people are assigned to the same seat; everyone has their unique spot. This means for every ticket holder, there's at most one seat (for each $y$, there's only one $x$).
>- If the function is **bijective**, then it's a perfect match: every seat is filled, and no one is sharing. Every concert-goer has a unique seat, and no seat is left empty.
>
>The Horizontal Line Test is like checking every row in the venue to make sure the seat assignment rule is followed correctly. If every line (horizontal line) hits exactly one person (for injective), and every seat is checked (for surjective), then the concert is perfectly organized (the function is bijective).
