- A subset  $X$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is **bounded** if, on the number line, its element to not extend to infinity to the left or right
- In other words: there exists real numbers $a,b$ with $a < b$ for which all points of $X$ are in the interval $(a,b)$ 
- The set $X$ is bounded if it is bounded above $b$ and below $a$, otherwise it's **ubounded**

>[!eq] **Examples**
>1. $\mathbb{Q}$ is unbounded
>	- Recall $\mathbb{Q}: \sqrt{2},\;\pi,\;e,\;3+\sqrt{2}, \dots$ 
>	- Neither above nor below
>2. $\mathbb{N}$ is bounded below $0$, but not above 
>	- Recall $\mathbb{N}: \set{1,2,3,4,5,\dots}$
>3. $(0,1), [0,1], [2,100]$ are bounded
>4. $\set{\cos x : x \in \mathbb{R}}$ is bounded
>	- Since all $\cos x$ values are between $[-1,1]$
