>[!eq] **Definition**
>- Let $S$ be a subset of $R$
>- If there is a number $m$ that is both an element of $S$ and an *upper bound* for $S$, then $m$ is called the **maximum element** of $S$
>	- Denoted $\max(S)$
>- If there is a number $i$ that is both an element of $S$ and a *lower bound*    for   $S$, then $i$ is called the **minimum element** of $S$
>	- Denoted $\min(S)$

>[!eq] **Not every set has a maximum element**
>- There are two reasons why a $S$ of $R$ might fail to have a maximum element
>1. $S$ might not be bounded above
>2. $S$ might be bounded above, but *might not contain an element that is an upper bound for itself*
>___
>- Consider the open interval $(0,1) \in R$
>- It is bounded above (1)
>- However take any element $x \in (0,1)$ 
>- Then $x$ is a real number that is strictly greater than $0$ and less than $1$
>- *Between $x$ and $1$* there are more real numbers, that are *greater than $x$* and belong to $(0,1)$
>- So $x$  cannot be an upper bound for the interval $(0,1)$

>___
>- An example of a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that does have a maximum and minimum is a *closed* interval like $[2,3]$ 
>	- Minimum = 2
>	- Maximum = 3
