### Divisibility
- Let a,b ∈ Z
- b divides a if a = b . q
	- Notation -> (a/b) = b | a
- e.g. 3 | 24 = 3 . 8
---
### Common divisor and GCD
- Let a,b ∈ N
- If  d|a and d|b -> d is a common divisor 
- The largest common divisor is referred to as the Greatest Common Divisor
	- Notation -> gcd(a,b)
- e.g. gcd(4,6) = 2
