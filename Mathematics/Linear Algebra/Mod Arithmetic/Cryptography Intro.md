- Idea is to encrypt messages to be able to send them through public channels while protecting the content
- We call **plaintext** the message we would like to send to some receiver
- We call **ciphertext** the *encrypted message* to be send through some public channel 
- Ideally our encryption method should be hard to crack and reversible 
___
## Private Key Cryptography 
- Based on some agreement between sender and whereby they agree on parameters that determine the encrypting function
- Our first example is [[Affine Ciphers]]
