>[!def] Tangent Space
>- The set of all possible direction in which you can pass through that point
>- if $M$ is a smooth manifold and $p$ is a point on $M$
>- The tangent space at $p$, denoted $T_p(M)$ is a vector space that contains the tangent vectors to all possible curves passing through $p$


>[!example] Example : Standing on a hill
>- Imagine you're standing on a hill (the hill is curved like a 2D manifold)
>- However, where ever you stand, you can think of the ground directly below you as flat
>- This flatness in a tangent plane

>[!example] Example: A tangent to a curve (1D)
>- Imagine driving along a curvy mountain road
>- The road is a curve, and at every point there is a straight line that touches the road at exactly one point and points in the direction the car is moving
