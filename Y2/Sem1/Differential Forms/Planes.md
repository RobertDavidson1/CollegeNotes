$$E^2 : \text{The Euclidian Plane}$$
- An Infinitely large "sheet of paper"
- **Vectors in $E^2$:**
	- A vector is a direction + magnitude
	- We draw them as arrows
	- Two operations
		1. Addition
		2. Multiplication
___
$$R^2 : \text{The cartesian plane}$$
- $E^2$ + A coordinate system
- We have **two $R^2$'s** 
	1. The manifold of $R^2$ (all points) $\set{(a,b) \mid a,b \in R^2}$
	2. The vector space of $R^2$ (all vectors) $\set{\langle a, b\rangle \mid a,b \in R^2}$
