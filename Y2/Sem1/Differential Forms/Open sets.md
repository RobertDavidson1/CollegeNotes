>[!example] A Coffee Cup
>- Imagine you place a small drop of coffee on the surface of the cup
>- That coffee will spread out into a circular region
>- This circular region on the surface of the coffee cup is what we would think of as an open set
>
>*Why is it open?:*
>- If you zoom into any point within this region, you won't encounter an edge or a boundary (all points are part of the set)
>-  If you were to move the drop closer to the handle, you'd get another open set - it might curve around the handle, but as long as there are no sharp edges / boundaries , the region remains open


>[!example] Non Open Sets
>- Imagine if we took a knife and sliced a circular hole into the surface of the coffee cup
>- This cut introduces a boundary to the region, now edges od the cut act as boundaries
