>[!def] Smoothness
>- The smoothness of a function is measured by the number of continuous derivatives (*differentiability class*) is has over its domain

>[!def] Smoothness Class
>- A function of class $C^k$ is a function of smoothness at least $k$
>- That is, a function, of class $C^k$ is a function that has a $kth$ derivative that is continuous in its domain 
>- [[Examples of different smoothness classes]]
