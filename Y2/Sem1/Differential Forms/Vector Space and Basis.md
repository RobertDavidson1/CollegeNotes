>[!def] Vector Space
>- Collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars
>- $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of all $n$-dimensional vectors


>[!def] Basis Vectors
>A set of vectors that:
>- ***Span the vector space*** 
>	- Any vector in the vector space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors
>- ***Are linearly independent***
>	- No vector in the basis can be written as a linear combination of the others

>[!example] Example : Basis in $R^2$
>$$\large \hat{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \hat{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
