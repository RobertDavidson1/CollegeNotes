>[!def] Span of basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$
>- We know $R^2$ is the span of all the basis vectors, which is equal to all points (x,y), as x,y range over all points in $R$
>$$\mathbb{R}^2 = \text{span} [(1,0)(0,1)] = [(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{R}]$$

>[!def] Span of tangent vector in $\mathbb{R^2}$
>- We look at a arbitrary point in $R^2$, and we look at all vectors tangent to $R^2$ that point 
>	- That will be every point because $R^2$ is flat

>$$T_p \mathbb{R^2} = \text{span}[\langle1,0\rangle, \langle 0,1 \rangle ] = [\langle dx,dy\rangle \mid dx,dy \in \mathbb{R}$$
