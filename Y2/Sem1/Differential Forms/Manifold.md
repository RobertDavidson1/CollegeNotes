>[!def] Definition
>- A **manifold** is a [[Topological space]] that locally resembles Euclidean Space $\mathbb{R}^n$ around each point
>- *i.e.:* a shape or surface that might be curved or complicated in a big-picture sense, but when you zoom in very closely at any point, it looks flat like regular space 

>[!def] Example - A sheet
>- Imagine a point $P$, and a very small neighborhood around $P$
>- If this neighborhood is flat, this area is euclidean
>	- no up and downs / curvatures
>- If this is the case for all the points and their neighborhoods
