>[!def] Definition
>- A **manifold** is a [[Topological space]] that locally resembles Euclidean Space $\mathbb{R}^n$ around each point
>- *i.e.:* a shape or surface that might be curved or complicated in a big-picture sense, but when you zoom in very closely at any point, it looks flat like regular space 

>[!example]  Example : The Circle ($\mathbb{S}^1$)
>- Global View : It is curved and wraps around itself
>- Local view: If you zoom in it looks like a flat place of line
