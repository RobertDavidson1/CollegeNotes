>[!example] Evaluate $a_p(v_p)$ given $\alpha$, a 1-form, $p$ a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and $\mathbf{v}_p$, a vector in $T_p(\mathbb{R}^3)$
>- $\alpha=xy dx+y^{2} dy - z dz$
>- $p = (1,0,1)$
>- $v_p = \langle 2,1,0 \rangle$

# Coordinate representation
- Let $\alpha$ be expressed in coordinates as:
$$\Large a = a_1 dx^1 + a_2dx^2 + a_3dx^3$$
- Where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$ are the components of the 1-form $\alpha$, in terms of the coordinate differentials $dx^1, dx^2, dx^3$

## Vector Representation
- Let the vector $v_p$ at the point $p$ have components:
$$\Large v_p=v^1\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}+v^2\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}+v^3\frac{\partial}{\partial x^3}.$$

# Applying 1-form:
- The 1-form acts on the vector by pairing its components with the components of the vector:
$$\Large \alpha_p(v_p)=\alpha_1(p)v^1+\alpha_2(p)v^2+\alpha_3(p)v^3.$$
