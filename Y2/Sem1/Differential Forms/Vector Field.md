>[!def] Vector Field
>- A vector field assigns a vector to every point in a distribution, typically a [[Manifold]]
>- To define vectors at every point of a [[Manifold]], we require the [[Tangent Space]] at each point, since every point has a unique tangent space
>- The collection of all tangent spaces across the manifold, together with the manifold itself, forms what is called a [[Tangent Bundle]]******

>[!def] Smooth Vector Field
>- A vector field is called **smooth**, if for every point, it is possible to find curves on a manifold, such that all the vectors on the vector field, are tangent to the curves 
>	- These curves are known as [[Integral curves]]
>	- The smooth vector field is often related to solutions of differential equations, where the integral curves represent the solutions.
