>[!def] Definition
>- Let $\mathbf{V}$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$
>- A basis of $\mathbf{V}$ is a set of vectors $\set{v_1, v_2, \dots v_n} \in \mathbf{V}$, such that:
>1. $\mathbf{V}  = \text{Span}\set{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n}$
>2. $\set{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n}$ is linearly independent 
>
>**Recall:**
>- Span: The collection of all linear combinations of vectors
>- A set of vectors is linearly independent if and only if, when you remove any vector from the set the span shrinks
