>[!def] Topological Space
>- A set of points, along with a structure that allows us to define what is meany for points to be "close" to each other, without needing to define a numerical distance

>[!example] Example: Coffee Cup:
>- We're interesting in the points on the surface of the cup - not the whole volume
>1. Define the Set
>	- Define the set $X$ - the points that make up the surface of the coffee cup 
>	- These points form the underlying set of our topological space.
>	- for now, imagine the set as a collection of points that cover the entire surface of the cup
>2. Define the Topology (Open Sets)
>	- We need to specif a collection open sets that form the topology on this set
>	- Think of [[Open sets]] as regions of the surface of the coffee cup that don't include their boundary edges
>3. Properties of the Toplogoy:
>	1. The whole surface and the empty set are open
>		- The entire surface of the coffee cup is considered an open set
>		- The empty set is also open by defintion
>	2. Arbitrary Unions of open sets are open
>		- Suppose you take two open sets: one near the handle, one near the rim, the union of these two open sets is still open
>	3. Finite intersections of open sets are open:
>		- Now, suppose two open sets overlap, such as one region covering part of the base, another region covering the side, the intersection is also open
