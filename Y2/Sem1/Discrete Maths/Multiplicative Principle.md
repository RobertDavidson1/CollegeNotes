>[!def] The Multiplicative Principle (Events)
>- If event $A$ can occur $m$ ways
>- and each possibility *allows* for $B$ to occur in $n$ ways
>- **Then $A$ and $B$ can occur in $m \times n$ ways**

>[!eq] The Multiplicative Principle (Sets)
>- Given two sets $A, B$
>$$|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|$$
>- Where "$\cdot$" is the [[Cartesian Product]]
