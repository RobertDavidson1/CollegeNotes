>[!def] The Additive Principle (Events)
>- If event $A$ can occur $m$ ways
>- And $B$ can occur $n$ ways (*disjoint*)
>- **Then $A$ or $B$ can occur $m+n$ ways**

>[!def] The Additive Principle (Sets)
>- Given two sets $A$ and $B$
>- $|A| = m, |B| = n$
>- if $|A \cap B|$ = 0, then: (*disjoint*)
>$$|A\cup B| = m + n$$
>$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$$
