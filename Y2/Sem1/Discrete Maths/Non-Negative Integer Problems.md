Each solution from the [[Stars and Bars]] can be framed as solution to the non-negative integer problem
$$x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n$$
Thus:


>[!def] A non-negative integer problem (NNI):
>How many non-negative integer solutions are there to the problem:
>$$x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n$$
>**Is the same as:** How many ways are there to distribute $n$ identical objects among $k$ individuals
>$$\begin{pmatrix}n +k - 1\\ k -1 \end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!}$$
